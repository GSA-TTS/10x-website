## Look Ahead to FY24

### FY24 investment focus

In the coming year, we see a shift towards longer-term investments that double-down on our existing areas of expertise — like our portfolio of equity-focused tech. When we reflect on all the 10x investments over the years, equity-focused investments stand out, both in terms of the quantity of ideas in our pipeline, but also because these investments are where 10x has naturally gravitated. 

Therefore, we've decided to double down on two new investment themes: <span class="text-italic">Reimagining Public Engagement</span> and <span class="text-italic">Equity in Delivery</span>. By betting on these two themes, we’re hoping to gather ideas on topics including:

- opportunities for the government and the public to co-design and build products and services together.
- innovative ways for governments to quickly respond to public inquiries.
- improving customer experience for the public.
- civil rights awareness.
- privacy preservation.
- environmental justice.
- fairness in emerging technologies. 
- social safety net innovations.

We intend to keep these investment themes for the foreseeable future. Within these themes, we're hoping to invest, and see real progress with, the following target areas.

### Boosting research practices across government

In FY23, we already succeeded in moving the needle in boosting government research practices. We were able to compensate research participants and conduct in-person user research with the public.

But as we discussed in <a href="#10x-dark-matter">"Dark Matter",</a> section, getting research right is critical. We have active investments in our pipeline that are working in concert on different facets of the issue. One investment is called "Intuitive Consent," which explores ways to make it easier for participants to sign up for federal research opportunities. Another is "Enabling Government Research Operations," which is exploring the possible value of a new research model where in-house, centralized agency research teams are available to serve all digital efforts across the agency. Proving the value of this approach, and seeing it scale widely across the government, would be transformative.

We’re beginning to see a path towards making diligent, ethical, and human-centered research ubiquitous across the federal government. In FY24, we're not just thinking about how to do it, but seeing how we can actualize it.

<p class="text-bold">Forms, Forms, Forms!</p>

Filling out and submitting government paperwork are two of the most common ways that the public  interacts with the federal government. Think small business loans, benefits applications, and annual tax forms. The government is <a class="usa-text usa-text--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text">under a lot of pressure</a> to make filling out forms easier for the public. That means that there is a lot of potential for innovation and impact in this area that 10x is already working on. 

We're taking a "try everything" approach to bettering government forms. Current investments such as <a href="#the-idea-1">"Digital Access to Justice Platform"</a> and <a class="usa-link usa-link-external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57764058">"Equitable Form Design"</a> and a new Phase One, <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/2024-selected-investments/' | url }}">"Improving the Customer Experience for Grievance Applicants,"</a> explore different facets of government forms. Through these investments we see a path towards a public experience that consistently meets the standards of the private sector, or in certain cases, eliminates the need for the public to fill out forms entirely. Getting there is far away, but 10x is excited to help  the government get ever closer.

### What's next

Since the earliest days of 10x, we've stuck with a <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/about/' | url }}">phased investment approach</a>. But change is healthy, and evolution is necessary for any business hoping to innovate.

10x embraces change, and our history reflects that. For example, the number of phases, their expected milestones, and funding levels have all evolved over the years. Even our staffing model is completely different than a year ago.

But all of these adaptations existed within our traditional model, or 10x Classic. This year, we’ve been asking, “What’s next?” 

Change is imperative to keep up with the pace of technology and current investment practices. 10x needs to adapt, or risk irrelevancy.

While we will continue funding 10x Classic, we’re going to experiment with and pilot a brand new approach in FY24. We can't reveal it right now so you'll have to wait until next year's Impact Report to see what we did and whether it worked. However, we will embrace and maintain a group of principles that will guide our big experiment in FY24:

<div class="blue-hilighted-insights">
    <ul>
        <li>We'll focus more on problems that directly impact the public.</li>
        <li>We'll take on more "moonshot" investments, which we call the big, risky, and promising ideas that can lead to transformative breakthroughs.</li>
        <li>We're going to build and test earlier.</li>
        <li>We're open to testing additional teaming arrangements that allow for greater specialization for our staff.</li>
        <li>We'll welcome new methods for sourcing problem statements and ideas.</li>
        <li>We'll cultivate a culture of learning and sharing.</li>
        <li>We'll measure impact to ensure we are delivering our mission.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

While we have always welcomed change, our primary focus throughout the years remains the same: Run towards hard problems. Focus on the public. Deliver impact for people.
