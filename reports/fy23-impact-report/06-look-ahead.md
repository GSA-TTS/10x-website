## Look Ahead to FY24

### FY24 Investment Focus

We have a healthy pipeline of investments to look forward to in FY24. We’ve selected two new investment themes:  Reimagining Public Engagement and Equity in Delivery. By betting on these two themes, we’re hoping to gather ideas on topics ranging from

- opportunities for the government and the public to co-design and build products and services together, 
- innovative ways for governments to quickly respond to public inquiries, 
- improving customer experience for the public, 
- civil rights awareness, 
- privacy preservation, 
- environmental justice, 
- fairness in emerging technologies, and 
- social safety net innovations.

In the coming year, we see a shift towards longer-term investments that double-down on our existing areas of expertise — like our portfolio of equity-focused tech. When we reflect on all the 10x projects over the years, equity-focused projects stand out, both in terms of the quantity of ideas in our pipeline, but also because these projects are where 10x has naturally gravitated.

Here are a few other areas we expect to invest heavily in, and see real progress with tangible results:

#### Boosting research practices across government

As we discussed in the Dark Matter section, getting research right is critical for the federal government. We have active projects that are working, in concert, on different facets of the issue. One project is called Intuitive Consent, which explores ways to make it easier for participants to sign up for federal research opportunities.

Another is Enabling Government Research Operations, which is exploring the possible value of a new research model where in-house, centralized agency research teams are available to serve all digital efforts across the agency. Proving the value of this approach, and seeing it scale widely across the government, would be transformative.

We’ve already succeeded in moving the needle in FY23: we were able to compensate research participants and conduct in-person, bilingual user research with the public. When taken collectively, and with further investment from 10x, we’re beginning to see a path towards making diligent, ethical, and human-centered research ubiquitous across the federal government. In FY24, we’re not just thinking about how to do it, but really making it happen.

#### Forms, Forms, Forms!

Filling out and submitting government paperwork are two of the most common ways that Americans interact with the federal government. Think small business loans, benefits applications, and annual tax forms.

Overall, the government needs to deliver better experiences with public forms, and are under a lot of pressure to do so. There is a lot of potential for innovation and impact in this area that 10x is already working on. 

**We’re taking a ‘try everything’ approach to making forms better** through many active projects in our pipeline, including Digital Access to Justice Platform and Equitable Form Design. Through these investments and more to come, we see a path towards a public forms experience that consistently meets the standards of the private sector. It should also, whenever possible, eliminate the need for the public to fill out forms entirely. Getting there is far away, but 10x is excited to help  the government get ever closer.

### What’s Next

Since we founded 10x more than five years ago, we’ve consistently stuck with our original, four- phase investment approach. But change is healthy, and evolving is a necessity for anyone in the innovation business. 

10x embraces change, and our history reflects that. For example, the number of phases, their expected milestones, and funding levels have all evolved over the years. Our staffing model is completely different, and we have more than three different talent pools to draw on. 

But all of these adaptations existed within our traditional four-phased model. We call this “10x Classic.” This year, we’ve been asking ourselves, What’s next? 

Now is the time to ask this question, because we need to evolve, not only in the spirit of innovation and experimentation, but also because technology is always changing, as are investment practices. 10x needs to reflect that, or risk becoming irrelevant.

We’re by no means starting from the ground up and will continue funding 10x Classic projects. But we will be experimenting with and piloting a brand-new investment approach throughout FY24. 

Here are a few of the principles that are important to us, and that we will embrace to help guide our big experiment in FY24:

<div class="blue-hilighted-insights">
    <ul>
        <li>We’ll focus more on problems that directly impact the public.</li>
        <li>We’ll take on more moonshot projects, which we call the big, risky, and promising ideas that can lead to transformative breakthroughs.</li>
        <li>We’re going to build and test earlier.</li>
        <li>We’re open to testing additional teaming arrangements that allow for greater specialization for our staff.</li>
        <li>We’ll welcome new methods for sourcing problem statements and project ideas.</li>
        <li>We’ll cultivate a culture of learning and sharing.</li>
        <li>We’ll measure impact to ensure we are delivering our mission.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

These principles are important, and we are committed to really putting them to practice in FY24. We hope our commitment to embracing change in FY24 is clear, but some things don’t need to change. Of all the guiding principles we’re taking into the new year, the most important among them will not change, and have endured throughout all the changes at 10x over the years:

Run towards hard problems. Focus on the public. Deliver impact for people.
