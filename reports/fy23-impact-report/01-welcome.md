## Letter from the Team

Dear Readers,

Welcome to Year Seven of the 10x Impact Report. For those reading for the first time, our goal is simple: showcase the impact that the 10x program has delivered for the American public and the Federal government over the last year.

This report will cover a lot of ground, but we’re using this letter to let you in on a few things we’re doing differently. Since our first impact report, we’ve been the ones telling you about all the great things we delivered.

But this year, we’ve decided to mix things up by looking outside our own program for a perspective on how we deliver value. We’ll share two letters written from our idea authors and partners that talk about their experience with 10x.  We hope that hearing from others will add valuable color to our own understanding of the value we provide.

There’s also been something brewing behind the scenes that we’re very excited about. This year, we reflected on where we are as a program and where we want to be in a few years. We'll touch on this more at the end of this report, but for now, we want to underline that the whole 10x team remains committed to innovating in the pursuit of public good. And that means taking big bold risks, and FY23 set us on a path to do exactly that. It was the year of looking into the future to see what we want to become, and we’ll talk about some of the changes we’re open to in FY24. We are thrilled for what’s coming up, and we hope you’ll be following along with us.

The 10x Team
