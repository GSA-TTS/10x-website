## 10x Dark Matter

<p class="text-italic">In scientific parlance, "dark matter" refers to everything that makes up the known universe that is neither visible nor detectable by humans using existing technology – about 85% of everything in the universe. To us, dark matter refers to the powerful but hard to pin down ideas that the 10x investment model delivers for civil servants. Dark Matter is a section we write about each year. It boils down to identifying and describing the hidden value in 10x work. Similar to our investments featured within the <a href="#tracing-ripples">"Trace the ripples"</a> section, we explore 10x's impact that isn’t product-shaped. Through dark matter, we ask the following question: What if 85% of the value that 10x delivers lies within great ideas, not software?</p>

### Where we start

This year’s Dark Matter  begins with a look at the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer"  href="https://vimeo.com/899915055/d314c2302a">The PMA is an essential guiding document</a> for the federal civil service, even if most people in the public have never heard of it. Each Presidential Administration issues a PMA and defines governmentwide management priorities for all federal agencies to improve how the government operates and performs.

When reading the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://assets.performance.gov/PMA/Biden-Harris_Management_Agenda_Vision_11-18.pdf">current PMA</a>, it becomes clear that our government puts a real emphasis on its <em>people</em>. It's listed first: <a class="usa-link usa-link--external text-italic" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/workforce/">Strengthening and empowering the Federal workforce</a>. Within this first priority, the PMA declares that "The strength of any organization rests on its <em>people</em>" and elaborates that agencies need to work to reverse below average employee engagement.

The PMA's second priority, <a class="usa-link usa-link--external text-italic" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/">Delivering excellent, equitable, equitable, and secure Federal services and customer experience</a>, is geared towards improving satisfaction rates with government services. Successful implementation means taking a specific mindset stating that "<em>People</em> are at the center of everything the Government does."

These two priorities focus on two separate, yet interrelated definitions of "people." First, federal employees and second, the public they serve. While they may be categorized independently within the PMA, 10x detects a strong link between them and believes that there are ample opportunities for executing on them simultaneously. This year's <span class="text-italic">Dark Matter</span> examines that connection and our perspective that the federal government might find transformative potential in bridging the gap between federal employees and the public.

### The gap

We don't believe and don't want to give the impression that federal workers and the public somehow exist independently of one another. Federal employees are members of the public and federal policies and programs impact them, too. Nevertheless, there is a specific and widely experienced gap in the ability of civil servants — particularly federal designers and technologists — to easily connect with members of the public. 

Although the collection of user data is commonplace within federal research, interacting directly with the public, even for something as simple as getting feedback on a new webpage, remains a challenge. "I can't speak directly with my users" is a refrain 10x has heard time and again from federal designers who build public-facing digital services

This is a real sore spot for 10x, as the lion’s share of our investments focus on delivering public-facing products and services. There are real agency concerns about running afoul of <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pra.digital.gov">Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) guidelines</a>, but there is often a lack of support or understanding of the value of UX from agency budget officials and leaders, as well as strict legal limitations from within an agency's General Counsel's Office. We believe these blockers aren't going away on their own, and that action is needed to help federal designers serve the public. We believe that the government should empower them to test products with and gather feedback directly from members of the general public. 

#### Why that matters

Digital modernization investments in government are unlikely to succeed when they are built without user input. And when it comes to critical public-facing websites and services, unusable products can lead to serious and negative real world consequences. On the other hand, there have been several instances where successful modernization efforts used user research to make a tremendous difference in peoples' lives. Think of the successful rollout of covidtesting<span>.</span>gov, which the General Services Administration (GSA) helped implement.

We believe the government's inability to effectively reach the public represents a missed opportunity to connect federal workers with the people they serve. Based on our experience over the last fiscal year, we've seen firsthand that connecting federal workers and the public has transformative potential both to improve public services and to strengthen the workforce. And we're focusing on one new way that the government can connect more with the public that's within our wheelhouse, and that something is what we're calling "inclusive research."

#### The transformative potential of inclusive research

"Inclusive research," as the name suggests, means diligent user research that meets at least one, but ideally both, of the following criteria: 

- Includes <span class="text-bold">participation of non-technical civil servants</span>, such as policy experts, budget authorities, or scientists, in either a formal or observatory capacity. 
- Directly <span class="text-bold">involves members of the general public</span> in research planning and execution.

Most people recognize that better products for the public result from strong research practices, but the benefits for the federal workforce are less obvious. We believe that connecting feds and the public through inclusive research practices can deliver:

- <span class="text-bold">Impact for the public</span> through better, human-centered digital experiences with the government.
- <span class="text-bold">Impact for the federal workforce</span> by helping them deliver on their missions, re-engaging them in their work, and offering a chance to learn new skills.

For an example of how 10x’s own inclusive research practices influenced both the public and the federal workforce, think of Connie, the grants policy wiz from IMLS we heard from earlier. Over the course of <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=61533554">"Finding Grant-Funded Results and Products"</a> the 10x team encouraged her to sit in on user interviews, and through this experience, she learned a lot about what her agency’s customers are really after. We can prove that her 10x experience was engaging, because she said so herself, <em>delaying retirement</em> so that she could see the results of her 10x investment through. Now that’s employee engagement.

Over the last year, 10x has invested time and resources into clearing a path for easier public-facing research in government, starting at home within our own agency. 10x has worked internally to secure permission to conduct in-person user testing sessions, and developed a framework to help determine when it's permissible to compensate members of the public who participate in user research. This required working hand in hand with agency advocates in IT, legal, and procurement. We think this could scale widely and help other agencies do the same.

This resulted in 10x conducting on-the-ground user interviews for the first time in our program’s history. In support of the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferror" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38?pane=issue&itemId=58755505">"Improving Language Access"</a> investment, 10x researchers were referred to bilingual members of the public by a trusted local organization in Atlanta, Ga. These interviews — which were with people whose preferred language is not English — generated eye opening results including:

- The participants were comfortable with their hands being recorded, but not their faces.
- The participants were only comfortable participating with a designer/researcher who could speak with them in their preferred language.
- Our designer had to be thoughtful in how to explain the purpose of the interview, and the exact language he used. For example, there are several possible Spanish words meaning "study," each with different connotations. One interpretation gives the impression that interview participants "are being studied," and one suggests a more voluntary arrangement.

These insights will not only lead to improved translation services for an underserved population, but that they are relevant for the entire civil service. And it was only possible to uncover these lessons by connecting with the public in meaningful ways.

Great digital experiences are rarely noticed, but the point isn't to build something that receives accolades. The point is for the government to build IT that makes a real difference in people's lives. And without the ability to easily connect with their real customers, civil servants will continue to struggle to deliver great experiences.

#### Where we go from here

Understanding real dark matter (the kind in outer space) is a colossal undertaking involving countless teams of scientists. Understanding the "dark matter" between two high-level priorities within the PMA we're describing may not require astrophysicists to decipher, but it does leave plenty to be explored. 

We've outlined our plan to connect feds with the public they service, but there are certainly other ways of building these connections. Not all of them will be explored by 10x, and that's where we want to call on the scores of dedicated civil servants to keep exploring. <a  class="usa-link usa-link--external text-italic" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/workforce/#:~:text=37%20complete%20%7C%2057%25-,Engage%20%26%20Support%20Employees,and%20thrive%20throughout%20their%20careers.">"Make every federal job a good job, where all employees are engaged, supported, heard, and empowered..."</a> states the PMA. To foster and build upon the connections between the federal workforce and the public we serve, civil servants need to put our innovator hats on. That sounds like a good job.
