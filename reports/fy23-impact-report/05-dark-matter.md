## 10x Dark Matter

The <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/">President's Management Agenda</a>, or PMA, is an essential guiding document for the federal civil service, even if most people in the public have never heard of it. Each Presidential Administration issues a PMA and defines governmentwide management priorities for all federal agencies to improve how the government operates and performs.

When reading the current PMA, it becomes clear that our government puts real emphasis on people. It's listed first, through its top priority of Strengthening and empowering the Federal workforce. Within this first priority, the PMA declares that "The strength of any organization rests on its people" and elaborates that agencies need to work to reverse below average employee engagement.

The PMA's second priority, Delivering excellent, equitable, equitable, and secure Federal services and customer experience, is geared towards improving satisfaction rates with government services. As the PMA states, "People are at the center of everything the Government does."

These two people-centered priorities focus on two separate, yet interrelated groups of people: federal employees and the people they serve. While they may be called out independently, 10x detects a strong connection between the two, and sees ample opportunities for executing on them simultaneously. This year's Dark Matter examines the connection between these pursuits and how our government might find transformative potential in bridging the gap between federal employees and the public.

### Bridging the Gap

We don't believe and don't want to give the impression that feds and the public somehow exist in different universes and have no points of contact. Federal employees are members of the public and federal policies and programs impact them, too. Nevertheless, there is a specific and widely experienced gap in the ability of civil servants — particularly federal designers and technologists — to easily connect with members of the public.

Although the collection of user data is commonplace in federal research, interacting directly with the public, even for something as simple as getting feedback on a new webpage remains a challenge for Feds. ‘I can't speak directly with my users' is a common pain point 10x has heard from federal designers who build public-facing digital services.

This is a real sore spot for 10x as the lion's share of our projects focus on delivering exactly these types of products and services. Real agency concerns about running afoul of Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) guidelines, a lack of support or understanding of the value of UX from agency budget officials and leaders, and strict legal limitations from within an agency's General Counsel's Office are just some of many blockers designers face. We believe those blockers aren't going away on their own, and that action is needed to help Federal designers serve the public, by empowering them to test products with and gather feedback directly with members of the general public.

### Why That Matters

Digital modernization projects in government are destined to fail when they are built without user input. And there have been several instances where significant modernization efforts for critical public-facing websites and services, where great digital experiences can make a tremendous difference in peoples' lives. Think emergency response, taxes, application forms, and more.

The public often experiences these technology failures as minor annoyances, but in extreme cases they cause financial catastrophe and other harmful outcomes. Without the ability to connect with real people, we will struggle to deliver excellent digital experiences for the public.

For the federal civil service, we believe this inability to effectively reach the public leads to more than unsuccessful product launches. It also represents a missed opportunity to connect feds with the people they serve in new ways. Based on our experience over the last fiscal year, we believe that connecting feds and the public has transformative potential both to improve public services and to strengthen the workforce.

There are many ways to connect the public and civil servants, and the government will need to innovate new ones in the future. As a team that builds software, we'll focus on one new way that the government can connect more with the public that's within our wheelhouse, something we're calling inclusive research.

### The Transformative Potential of Inclusive Research

To us, inclusive research in the federal space means diligent user research that meets at least one, but ideally both, of the following criteria:

- Includes **participation of non-technical civil servants**, such as policy experts, budget authorities, or scientists, in either a formal or observatory capacity. 
- Directly **involves members of the general public** in research planning and execution.

For an example of inclusive research practices from the last fiscal year, think of Connie, the grants policy wiz from IMLS we heard from earlier. Over the course of  the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/c/qRIRMv6b">Finding Grant-Funded Results and Products</a> project, the 10x project team encouraged her to sit in on user interviews. She jumped at the opportunity and learned a lot about what her agency's customers are really after. We can prove that her 10x experience was engaging, because she said so herself to the point that she delayed retirement so that she could see the results of her 10x project through. That's employee engagement.

Another good example is the work 10x did on the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/c/8ySmUOq1">Improving Language Access</a> project in FY23, which involved 10x researchers in the field conducting face-to-face bilingual user interviews with the public.

Strong research practices can help deliver benefits to end users in the public that are fairly intuitive. The benefits for the federal workforce are less so, but still significant. We believe that connecting feds and the public through inclusive research practices can deliver massive, positive results for both "peoples":

- **Impact for the public** through improved, human-centered digital experiences with the government.
- **Impact for the federal Workforce** by helping them deliver on their missions, re-engaging them, and giving them a chance to learn new skills.

Consider the bilingual research we mentioned above. Connecting in-person with vulnerable populations — people who can't communicate effectively in English — was eye opening. Here are a few highlights from that experience:

- The interview participants were referred to 10x by a trusted local organization.
- The participants were comfortable with their hands being recorded, but not their faces.
- The participants were only comfortable participating with a designer/researcher who could speak with them in their language.
- Our designer had to be thoughtful in how to explain the purpose of the interview, and the exact language he used. For example, there are several possible Spanish words meaning ‘study,' each with different connotations. One interpretation gives the impression that interview participants ‘are being studied', and one suggests a more voluntary arrangement.

We believe that insights like these will not only lead to improved translation services for an underserved population, but that they are relevant for the entire civil service. It is only possible to uncover these lessons by connecting with the public in meaningful ways.

The point here isn't that user research is important, even though it is. The point is that user research with actual members of the public interacting directly can lead to so much more than nice websites, and that this type of research can and should involve basically anyone in the civil service: policy experts, attorneys, IT specialists, astronauts, and more.

10x has invested time and resources into clearing a path for easier public-facing research in government, starting at home within our own agency. Over the last year, 10x has worked internally to secure permission to conduct in-person user testing sessions, and developed a framework to help determine when it's permissible to compensate members of the public who participate in user research. This required working hand in hand with agency advocates in IT, legal, and procurement. We think this could scale widely and help other agencies do the same.

### Where We Go From Here

Understanding real dark matter (the kind in outer space) is a colossal undertaking involving countless teams of scientists. The dark matter between the high-level priorities for the civil service outlined in the PMA may not require astrophysicists, but it does leave plenty to be explored, and will also require the effort of many. We outlined our grand plans for making an impact by connecting feds and the public through inclusive research. But there are certainly other ways of building these connections, and not all of them will be explored by 10x.

We'll end by referencing the PMA one more time. Another quote that sticks out to us, states that a strategy for improving the workforce is to "Make every Federal job a good job, where all employees are engaged, supported, heard, and empowered..," To build on the connections between the Federal workforce and the public they serve, we civil servants need to put our innovator hats on, and there are many styles to choose from. That sounds like a good job.
