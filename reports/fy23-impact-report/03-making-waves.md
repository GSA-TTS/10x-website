## Making waves

This is the "Don't take our word for it" section. We want you to hear directly from the folks outside GSA who interact with 10x projects in one way or another. That's our Idea Authors, users, product owners, agency champions, and the people who wear multiple hats simultaneously or interchangeably.

Here are stories from two individuals who devoted time to working with 10x project teams in FY23, in their own words. Without engaged partners like Carey and Connie on our side, 10x can't deliver the impact we're really after. For their enthusiasm and hard work we are tremendously grateful.

<section class="testimonial-text" aria-labelledby="careys-story">
    <h3 id="careys-story" tabindex="-1">Carey's story</h3>
    <p class="text-italic">I submitted the idea for the project <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=61533312">Improving Response and Tracking of Sewer Spills</a> during the FY22 round of idea evaluation. And I worked with 10x across its lifecycle before it concluded after Phase Two.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">I help EPA and state inspectors collaborate through EPA's National Targeting Center, which focuses on improving their inspection and enforcement using innovative online tools (many of which are available through EPA public-facing system called <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://echo.epa.gov/">ECHO</a>). I also help implement an <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/compliance/npdes-ereporting">EPA rulemaking</a> that requires Clean Water Act (CWA) permittees and regulators to use existing, available information technology to electronically report information and data related to the CWA permit program instead of filing written reports.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">I submitted to 10x because I was looking for a way to jumpstart EPA's implementation of CWA electronic reporting for sewer spill reports. Sewage treatment plants submit these reports when there is an unexpected release of sewage from the sewer collection system. I also wanted to help make these data accessible and usable for EPA and state inspectors and the general public. Each year there are tens of thousands of sewer spills that negatively affect communities by polluting their environments and homes. Switching to electronic reporting and standardizing this noncompliance reporting will help EPA and states provide more effective and efficient oversight. It will also provide transparency to the public on the locations of frequent sewer spills, including if they are in areas of environmental justice concerns, such as underserved communities.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">So I jotted my idea down, and hit submit.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">Over the course of Phases One and Two, the 10x team I worked with was able to pivot based on the new resources EPA received to start on a solution for electronic data collection and reporting. 10x helped us understand our customers better and make user needs a top priority as we moved forward with the electronic reporting transition (which centers on a public-facing system called ECHO). At the end of Phase Two, 10x provided us with the research and artifacts that we needed to improve accessibility to ECHO, allowing the  EPA to move forward without further assistance.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">Since then, we've established a working group with our users to refine the visual design that 10x helped us create. The first new feature for product refinement is a search capability for the tool, which we'll be coding and implementing later this year.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">Overall, I would describe my experience as "easy and light."  The expectations that 10x had for me were always reasonable. My input was always welcomed, I got to sit in on user research, and I was encouraged to keep in regular communications. I was pleased that 10x required very little paperwork on my end, even though they were deep in the weeds helping us out. I would describe the culture of 10x as friendly, collaborative, and enthusiastic about innovation.</p>

    <h3 id="connies-story" tabindex="-1">Connie's story</h3>
    <p class="text-italic">Throughout my entire career, I've never been very far from the world of federal grants and at times, have been in the very heart of it. I'm an archaeologist by trade. Long before I ever joined the civil service, I spent many humid afternoons in a remote village in Northern Luzon conducting field work for my dissertation on local agriculture. That research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. I spent many more years working in museums and also benefited from the federal grants ecosystem along the way.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">It's now 2023 and at the end of the year, I'll be retiring from my dream job as the Director of Grants Policy and Management at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Like I said, I've never been far from Federal grants.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">During my time at the agency, I noticed a peculiarity in the nature of the grants that I came across. Most scientific research funded by Federal grants gets published. There's a culture of sharing and debating in science, because the discipline demands rigorous peer-reviewing. </p>
    <p class="text-italic">But for non-scientific grants, like those for artists and museums that I was encountering, the same expectation of publishing for maximizing visibility simply isn't there. I was learning that not all work supported by Federal grants is equally visible. The idea I submitted to 10x that kickstarted the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=61533554">Finding Grant-Funded Results and Products</a> project all began with that observation.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">My role at IMLS has given me a chance to be involved in many aspects of what the agency does, from improved outreach and marketing grants opportunities to impact measurement, and more.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">One initiative the agency undertook over the last few years that I was involved in was to develop a partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to maximize value out of a system we both used called eGMS, or Electronic Grants Management System. Most of our agency's funding goes where it should go: supporting museums and libraries. This means our budget for other projects, like making improvements to eGMS, is very limited. So the work has focused mostly on co-developing training materials with NEA for a job aid manual, rather than on the more technical and research oriented areas where we are under-resourced.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">The next workstream on the eGMS front is to figure out how to retrieve grant performance reports out of eGMS, and then publish them on our website. But I believe there are other possibilities as well. So late one night after mulling over an email promo from 10x I saw earlier in the day, I jotted down a few sentences and submitted my idea to 10x. The idea was for a capability that would allow potential grants applicants to — among other thing — find the results and products of previous grants from across agencies. This would maximize the potential discovery and reuse of the great work these grants have funded.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">The alternative, the status quo, is that much of this great taxpayer funded work ends up in a manilla folder in a filing cabinet that is then deleted from the Federal archives after seven years.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">10x picked up the idea and we went through two wonderful phases of 10x together, before the project ended with a recommendation that 10x not fund the work for Phase Three. Most of the work I observed during those two phases really focused on challenging us to understand our users' needs. They were excited that we had ideas of our own (making more grants content publicly available on our website) and encouraged us to think beyond, and really ask what we were hoping to accomplish, and what problem we were trying to solve. This was an eye-opening engagement.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">One of the main reasons 10x recommended against moving forward with Phase Three was because we at IMLS had been evolving as an organization and the 10x team felt that it was time to pass the baton back to us. They recommended the work move forward and made a persuasive case that the potential for impact to the public was enormous, but that the time was right for IMLS to progress independently.</p>
    <p class="text-italic">None of this was a heartbreak for us. Partly because the 10x team I worked with were so warm, so communicative, and so professional that I always felt looped-in. I got to sit in on real user interviews for the first time, and our agency learned so much about what our customers are really after that we'll put to use in the future. We're more confident in our ability to envision our own tech-enabled future and to define our needs. We have a much better sense of how to marry technology and our agency's mission. We're more self-sufficient at home and are less dependent on outsourcing our problem-solving to others. This is an exciting shift I've seen within IMLS, and 10x has helped us get there. </p>
