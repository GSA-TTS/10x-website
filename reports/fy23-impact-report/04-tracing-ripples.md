## Tracing Ripples

This section addresses a central conundrum that 10x has to contend with for as long as we try to define  what it means to be a Federal Venture Studio. Private Sector Venture Studios, meaning those that exist in the make-profit can easily determine whether or not their investments have been successful in the long term by looking for their ROI, or return on investment. Numbers in a bank account tell that story.

But that's not the case for 10x. As a Federal Venture Studio, the returns we seek on our investments–intangible improvements in digital experiences for the public—can't be reflected meaningfully by numbers in a bank account. Proving our investments' long-term success isn't simple.

To square this circle, we try to 'trace the ripples'. Here, our initial investments are a tiny stone dropped in a big pond. The 'ripples' that spread from there are the long-term positive changes we hope to see from our products and ideas. To evaluate our long-term ROI, we follow those ripples to see which stubborn driftwood gets loosened. In other words, we keep an eye on the projects that graduate from 10x. This year, we caught up with two product owners, both of whom work on programs that 10x invested in years ago, to see what and how they're delivering impact post-10x.

### Investments in Design Innovation

The history of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) goes all the way back to the very beginning of 10x, when we were known by another name (The Great Pitch) and ideas were submitted in person. The Design System has gone on to great things ever since, making the ripples of our initial investment relatively easy to follow.

First, we've seen evidence that the Design System has scaled. Knowledge of USWDS is virtually ubiquitous in the federal design space — most practitioners have heard of it, which was not the case five years ago. In addition, the user base is enormous, with USWDS components found on hundreds of government websites, with collective site views in the hundreds of millions. 

Second, its value was noticed by the highest levels of the government. USWDS was highlighted in <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text">legislation</a> as a solution that agencies can use to help deliver excellent digital experiences to the public. A recent OMB <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf">memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience</a> highlighted guidelines, best practices, and techniques for usability testing that the USWDS has been helping agencies develop for years.

10x has also invested in other USWDS-focused projects — or projects that eventually ended up within their purview — including a project in 2020 focused on shipping digital forms components to aid the government's years-long effort to transition from paper-based processes to digital.

One of the recommendations from the 10x team on that project was for USWDS to "lower the barriers to contribution." This has really stuck with and influenced the future development of the design system, as the product owner tells us.

Contribution refers to the USWDS community, and growing a community of federal UX designers, developers, researchers, and advocates to share and interact in open sourced forums and other open communication channels is one of the next big endeavors for the USWDS team.

The end goal of this community-building is to increase adoption and empower teams to make improvements and engage with hard problems that can't always be solved independently.  If users develop skilled teams that can use USWDS and position USWDS as a platform that can and should improve with feedback and contributions, they can solve their problems and innovate independently. They won't need to route through USWDS directly, but they can still  be active participants in shaping the future of government digital services.

Scaling through community was never a guaranteed path to success. As we learned from this conversation, there were other paths that USWDS could have taken instead of what it became. But we believe USWDS is well-positioned to continuously deliver impact well into the future. Their position can help facilitate interactions, elevate new ideas, and encourage testing in the open. Through this role located centrally within the federal design ecosystem, USWDS will continue adapting to emerging trends and changing user needs within this thriving community. 

### Investments in Notifications Technology

In 2022, 10x concluded three phases of the US Notify project, which delivered a notifications  product called  <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.notify.gov">Notify.gov</a>. <span class="text-bold">This shared services platform can help federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments more effectively communicate with their program participants</span> through texting. The product is being piloted by TTS' Public Benefits Studio, a team that develops shared technology tools and best practices for all kinds of benefits programs simultaneously.

Since graduating from 10x, the Benefits Studio has gone a long way in helping Notify succeed. They've accomplished a lot behind the scenes by doing the heavy lifting - invisible to users - that is required to make products like this work in government:

- Standing up a real team of engineers, designers, and program managers; 
- Securing high-level support from within our own agency; 
- Communicating a value proposition to attract users; 
- Navigating tricky legal and regulatory hurdles;
- Working through partners' concerns around privacy and cybersecurity;
- And lots more.

But it's not all paperwork. Notify has users. With the Notify team's help to design message content, get the data, and measure success, the first pilot partner has already sent messages. Use cases pilot partners have identified include sending texts to alert end-users of fraudulent activity, sending important weather alerts, and sending recertification reminders for expiring benefits.

Among the five pilot partners are government organizations at the federal, state, county, and city level. That's the nascent adoption of a 10x product at FOUR different levels of government!

All that's happened in the year since 10x successfully transitioned the product to its new home, and we can't wait to see what this next year will bring.
