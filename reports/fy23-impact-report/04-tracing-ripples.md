## Tracing ripples

<p class="text-italic">This section addresses a central conundrum that 10x has had to contend with for as long as we've been a federal venture studio. Private sector venture studios can easily determine whether or not their investments have been successful in the long term by looking at each investment's return on investment, or ROI. And often that's money in a bank account. But that's not the case for 10x. As a federal venture studio, the returns we seek on our investments – intangible improvements in digital experiences for the public — can't be reflected meaningfully by traditional metrics. Proving our investments' long-term success isn't as simple.</p>

<p class="text-italic">So instead, we try to "trace the ripples" of our graduated investments. We think of our investments as a tiny stone dropped in a big pond; the ripples that spread are the long-term positive changes we hope the public experiences from our investments. We caught up with two product owners, both of whom work on programs that 10x invested in years ago, to see what ripples are present.</p>

### Investments in design innovation

The history of the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> goes all the way back to the very beginning of 10x, when we were known by another name: The Great Pitch. Back then, ideas were submitted in person, in the style of Shark Tank. One of the ideas that was pitched was the "Design System." The pitch for the "Design System" was to create a style guide for federal websites so the public could have a consistent, and user-friendly, experience. The "Design System" has since gone on to scale, making the ripples of our initial investment relatively easy to follow. 

First, knowledge of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) is virtually ubiquitous in the federal design space — most practitioners have heard of it, which was not the case five years ago. In addition, the user base is enormous, with USWDS components found on hundreds of government websites, and with collective site views in the hundreds of millions. If you've ever  seen the banner that says, "An official website of the federal government" that's USWDS' doing.

Second, its value has been cited by the highest levels of the government. USWDS was highlighted in <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text">legislation</a> as a solution for agencies to deliver excellent digital experiences to the public. More recently, OMB issued an <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/">executive memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience</a> that highlighted guidelines, best practices, and techniques for usability testing that USWDS has been helping agencies develop for years.

Since 2015, 10x has also invested in other USWDS-specific investments including an investment in 2020 focused on shipping digital forms components to aid the government's years-long effort to transition from paper forms. One of the recommendations from the 10x team on that investment was for USWDS to "lower the barriers to contribution" for federal UX designers, developers, and researchers. This has really stuck with and influenced the future development of the "Design System," as the product owner tells us. An open sourced forum and other open communication channels is one of the next big endeavors for the USWDS team.

Scaling through community was never a guaranteed path to success. There were other paths that USWDS could have taken instead of what it became. But we believe USWDS is well-positioned to continuously deliver impact well into the future. Their position within the federal government can help facilitate interactions, elevate new ideas, and encourage testing in the open, and USWDS will continue to adapt to emerging trends and changing user needs within this thriving community. 

### Investments in notifications technology

In 2022, <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/notify' | url }}">10x concluded three phases of the "U.S. Notify" investment</a> and delivered a product called  <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.notify.gov">Notify.gov</a> (Notify), modeled off the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Notify System</a>. This shared services platform will help federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments more effectively communicate with program participants through texting. The product is being piloted by <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GSA/public-benefits-studio">TTS' Public Benefits Studio</a>, a team that develops shared technology tools and best practices for all kinds of benefits programs simultaneously.

While a recent graduate of 10x, the ripples are ever present. Since its graduation, the Benefits Studio has gone a long way in helping Notify succeed, such as: 

- Standing up a real team of engineers, designers, and program managers.
- Securing high-level support from within our own agency. 
- Communicating a value proposition to attract users. 
- Navigating tricky legal and regulatory hurdles.
- Working through partners' concerns around privacy and cybersecurity.

Notify also has its first users – five pilot partners in fact – all of which are government organizations at the federal, state, county, and city level. Their first pilot partner, the state of Washington, has already sent messages and identified more use cases, including texts to alert end-users of fraudulent activity, sending important weather alerts, and sending recertification reminders for expiring benefits.

All this has happened within the year since 10x successfully transitioned the product to its new home. If this first year's successes are any indication, <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.notify.gov">Notify.gov</a> is poised to be a big success. We can't wait to see the way the ripples spread.
