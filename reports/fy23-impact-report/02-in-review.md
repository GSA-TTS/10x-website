## FY23 in Review

### Our investment strategy

Each year, we identify investment areas to help steer our investments pipeline. These are often areas where we either have an established record of success, or towards a new area of exploration we want to pursue. We call these investment themes, and in FY23 our investment themes were <span class="text-italic">Digital Foundations</span> and <span class="text-italic">Equity in Delivery</span>.

With the <span class="text-italic">Digital Foundations</span> theme, we wanted to fund investments for digital innovations to support the country's massive new investments in physical infrastructure. <span class="text-italic">Equity in Delivery</span> investments cover topics of justice, access, and using tech to help those most in need. <span class="text-italic">Equity</span> is an investment theme we return to again and again, and where we've found success. We expect to double-down on this portfolio of investments again in FY24.

Sometimes an idea reflects <span class="text-italic">both</span> of our investment themes. A good example of this is an idea we received called <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/c/BkfVw9Ip">"De-Biasing Public Infrastructure Investments</a>." The observation of this investment is that government investments in public infrastructure do not always take into account possible negative effects that these investments can have on local populations, and in particular, vulnerable communities. For example, a city might build a much-needed highway, but in a way that divides a lower-income neighborhood and displaces residents.

The Idea Author's hypothesis was that 10x could deliver value by researching and, if necessary, delivering a new digital capability that ensures underrepresented populations have the opportunity and platform to provide input into the planning and prioritization of new infrastructure investments. We felt the impact we would deliver in the event that the problem was both significant and technically-solvable was worth the investment of Phase One resources.

In our Phase One research, we learned that the problem is real and not everyone has equitable access to new infrastructure, or a strong voice in naming infrastructure priorities. We also learned this is not an unknown problem and there are many resources and efforts at the federal and local levels to address this issue. For example, recent Executive Orders and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) instruct federal agencies to emphasize equity across all investments.

Even though this area has significant potential, we ultimately elected not to proceed with Phase Two of this investment due to the risk of duplicating existing and promising efforts. Based on our Phase One Investigation into the idea, we do not see a slam-dunk path for 10x to add value in the space of infrastructure equity. If 10x were to revisit this investment in the future, the Phase One team suggests focusing on specific case studies and examining how investments impact specific underprivileged groups, rather than looking for meta-solutions.

### Other bets we placed

We funded <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/2024-selected-investments/' | url }}">18 brand new Phase One investments</a> this year – 17 of which aligned with at least one of our two investment themes.

Here are two good examples of investments we funded that align with our investment priorities:

#### Resources for Formerly Incarcerated Persons

#### The idea

<p class="text-italic">More than 650,000 people are released from prison every year, but studies show that the recidivism rate is at nearly 66 percent. While many government agencies offer guidance for the formerly incarcerated, we believe this issue is so high profile in society today that it warrants further exploration by 10x.</p>

<p class="text-italic">For example, we have observed that there is no centralized, government-led resource for formerly incarcerated individuals to learn about reentry services, social safety net programs, or record expungement - services that help keep people out of the prison system. 10x will explore current government offerings in this space and investigate creating a centralized resource to help support both individuals leaving prison and the network of local and national nonprofit organizations dedicated to supporting their reentry.</p>

#### Why Bet on This?

We bet big on equity-centered tech to help people who need it most, and we chose this investment because it fits perfectly within that portfolio. We saw in this idea an opportunity to help thousands of people who leave prisons and jails, a disproportionate amount of whom are minority and low-income, successfully move back into society.

<div class="blue-hilighted-insights">
    <h4 id="project-insights-1" tabindex="-1">Insights</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>About two in three people who are released from prison will be rearrested within three years of their release.</li>
        <li>The recidivism rate is much higher for people with low education levels and limited access to affordable housing and healthcare.</li>
        <li>There are several pre-existing resources and approaches that prioritize empowerment and collaboration among local organizations.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### How it Went

Early on, our Phase One team learned that there are resources that are already available and often designed to accommodate the nuanced structures and jurisdictions of state and municipal governments. We also learned that most people incarcerated in the country end up there through state and local justice systems, not federal. 

Learning this was a signal to our team that this investment may not be the best place for 10x to operate. 
First, 10x is a <em>federal</em> program. Our ability to work with and help at the state and local government levels is limited. This meant that the beneficiaries and users of a solution we develop would need to be scoped solely to those who have interacted with the federal prison systems. But this is only 10% of the entire target population — not a sizable percentage. 

Second, the fact that there are several existing resources and organizations working in this space suggests that reentry resource access may not be a key issue in helping people avoid recidivism. Anything 10x tried to do could be duplicative. And because many of those resources are from local organizations, they are likely better suited to address the distinctions within each community better than the federal government. 

All of this made moving to Phase Two feel risky, and creating a centralized resource to support formerly incarcerated individuals at the federal level might be unfeasible and/or unnecessary. Ultimately, we decided not to move forward. 

But at 10x we love celebrating our "No's" – investments that produce great research and results, but that don't result in a recommendation for a new product or service. We view closing unpromising investments and sharing the learnings as a win. So even though we did not move this forward, we do not count this as a failure.

Of course, we did find some resounding "Yes" investments as well. Here's a good example from FY23:

<h4><a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/projects/38?pane=issue&itemId=58755590">Digital Access to Justice Platform</a> (formerly known as Transparency in Fines and Fees)</h4>

#### The idea

<p class="text-italic">Many people owe fines and fees to the federal government, often amounts that are initially less than $50, such as co-payments to the Veterans Health Administration, late fees associated with loan repayments, etc. If left unpaid, these accrue over time and across agencies when people do not realize what they owe, costing the government and taxpayers valuable time and money.</p>

<p class="text-italic">10x will explore ways to compile data on fees owed to agencies, such as a personal dashboard or notifications capability that offers visibility into fees owed to the government with links to repayment or forbearance options. This could reduce indebtedness, increase satisfaction with government services, and reduce time on call centers.</p>

#### Why bet on this?

Consider a hypothetical but realistic use case: a member of the public who needs to file a petition for a restraining order with the court can't complete that task, because the forms and processes needed to do so are designed and written for attorneys. The vast majority of petitioners do not have an attorney or other legal representation, and while they can file the petition themselves, the process itself imposes burdens that may delay or interfere with taking this legal action to protect themselves. Making a difference by simplified, guided form completion for people in these types of situations is exactly the type of impact 10x is proud to pursue.

<div class="blue-hilighted-insights">
    <h4 id="project-insights-2" tabindex="-1">Insights</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial hypothesis – a dashboard or a notification system for fines and fees – is unlikely to solve the problem or increase satisfaction with government services, and it would introduce significant privacy and interagency data sharing challenges.</li>
        <li>Most form-related products within the civil legal system were designed with lawyers in mind as the intended user base. However, a growing portion of that user base is non-legal professionals, and the public who often lack any kind of representation. This is a big problem.</li>
        <li>This space is ripe with opportunity and filled with enthusiastic stakeholders working towards the same goal. The team found engaged collaborators and potential partners.</li>
    </ul>

#### How it's going

"Digital Access to Justice Platform" is a great example of how the 10x process embraces change. Our teams have the freedom to recommend pivots from original directions when new paths of delivering impact emerge over the course of a given Phase.

In this case, the initial idea that focused on resolving fines and fees didn’t feel like a winning bet for 10x. But the team did find an opportunity to help in a different way, which was to improve the digital experience people have with the justice system.

The new opportunity in this space that our team will be pursuing in Phase Three during FY24 addresses a problem that our team uncovered in earlier phases: that "justice forms" are designed for lawyers, when the majority of people who interact with the system are not lawyers, nor have lawyers to represent them. 

The first use case within the court system is to deliver shared technology for facilitating online interviews for members of the public seeking legal redress. If successful, we'll deliver impact by helping people assemble the documents they need to advocate for themselves within the justice system, and eventually scale to other public interactions with the government.

### Celebrating "No"

As is typical for any Impact Report, we want to highlight the body and breadth of our work, and showcase select 10x investments in FY23. But, unlike typical Impact Reports, we also want to call attention to the investments we’ve said "No" to.

At 10x, we celebrate "No."  Saying "No" is an expression of why our approach to funding ideas, investments, and products works. If we can't justify spending time and money on an investment, we stop funding it. And, in fact, we've said "No" more times than we've said "Yes." But it means that we are shifting our resources to the investments and products that show the biggest potential, the biggest impact. 

So, yes. We celebrate "No."
