## FY23 in Review

### Our Investment Strategy

Each year, we identify priority areas of investment to help steer our project pipeline, either in a direction where we have an established record of success or towards a new area of exploration we want to pursue. We call these investment themes, and in FY23 our investment themes were _Digital Foundations and Equity in Delivery_.

With the _Digital Foundations_ theme, we wanted to fund projects for digital innovations to support the country’s massive new investments in physical infrastructure. This theme was new for us, timely and relevant.

_Equity in Delivery_ projects cover topics of justice, access, and using tech to help those most in need. Equity is an investment theme we return to again and again, and where we’ve found success. We expect to double-down on this portfolio of projects again in FY24.

A good example of an idea we received and funded that aligns well with both of these themes is our <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/c/BkfVw9Ip">De-Biasing Public Infrastructure Investments</a> project.

The hypothesis of this project was that researching and, if necessary, delivering a new technology capability to ensure underrepresented populations have a fair opportunity and  platform to provide input into the planning and prioritizing of new infrastructure projects. We felt the impact we would deliver in the event that  the problem was both significant and technically-solvable was  worth the investment of Phase One resources.

We learned that the problem is real and not everyone has equitable access to new infrastructure, or a strong voice in naming infrastructure priorities. We also learned this is not an unknown problem and there are many resources and efforts at the Federal and local levels to address this issue. For example, recent Executive Orders and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) instruct Federal agencies to emphasize equity across all investments.

Even though this area has significant potential, we ultimately elected not to proceed with Phase Two of this project due to the risk of duplicating existing, promising efforts. Based on our Phase One Investigation into the idea, we do not see a slam-dunk path for 10x to add value in the space of infrastructure equity. If 10x were to revisit this project in the future, the Phase One team suggests focusing on specific case studies and examining how investments impact specific underprivileged groups, rather than looking for meta-solutions.

### Other Bets we Placed

We funded 18 brand new Phase One projects this year–17 of which aligned with at least one of  our two investment themes.

Here are two good examples of projects we funded that align with our investment priorities:

#### Resources for Formerly Incarcerated Persons

_More than 650,000 people are released from prison every year, but studies show that the recidivism rate is at nearly 66 percent. While many government agencies offer guidance for the formerly incarcerated, we believe this issue is so high profile in society today that it warrants further exploration by 10x._

_For example, we have observed that there is no centralized, government-led resource for formerly incarcerated individuals to learn about reentry services, social safety net programs, or record expungement -- services that help keep people out of the prison system. 10x will explore current government offerings in this space and investigate creating a centralized resource to help support both individuals leaving prison and the network of local and national nonprofit organizations dedicated to supporting their reentry._

#### Why Bet on This?

We bet big on equity-centered tech to help people who need it most, and we chose this project because it fits perfectly within that portfolio. We saw in this idea an opportunity to help thousands of people (disproportionately minority and low-income) who leave prisons and jails each year successfully move back into society.

    <ul>
        <li>About two in three people who are released from prison will be rearrested within three years of their release.</li>
        <li>People with low education levels and limited access to affordable housing and healthcare are much more likely to be incarcerated after release.</li>
        <li>This is an important topic, but 10x is not the best avenue to move that work. Alternative approaches that prioritize local empowerment and collaboration among local organizations is the most appropriate path forward.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### How it Went

Early on, our Phase One team learned that resources for this population and their families are available, and often designed to accommodate the varied structures and jurisdictions of state or municipal governments. We also learned that most people incarcerated in the country end up there through state and local justice systems–not federal. 

Learning this was a signal to our team that this project may not be the best place for 10x to operate. 

First, 10x is a federal program, and our ability to work and help at the state and local government levels are limited. This also hints that our intended users or beneficiaries of a solution we develop may need to be scoped to the slice of the population who has interacted with the federal prison systems. As we noted above, that slice is only about 10% of the entire target population–what private venture studios call the Total Addressable Market, or TAM. 

Second, the fact that there are existing resources and organizations working in this space suggest that reentry resource-access may not be a key issue in helping people avoid recidivism, and that anything 10x tried to do could be duplicative. 

All of this made moving to Phase Two feel risky,  and that creating a centralized resource to support formerly incarcerated individuals at the federal level might be unfeasible and unnecessary. We decided not to move forward, but at 10x we love celebrating the ‘no’s–projects that produce great research and results, but that don’t result in a recommendation for a new product or service. We view closing unpromising projects and sharing the learnings as a win.

Of course, we found some resounding ‘Yes’ projects. And projects that do result in recommendations for exciting new technology are also wins. Here’s a good example from FY23:

<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/c/25Jl6NwJ">Digital Access to Justice Platform</a> (formerly known as Transparency in Fines and Fees)

_Many people owe fines and fees to the federal government, often amounts that are initially less than $50, such as co-payments to the Veterans Health Administration, late fees associated with loan repayments, etc. If left unpaid, these accrue over time and across agencies when people do not realize what they owe, costing the government and taxpayers valuable time and money._

_10x will explore ways to compile data on fees owed to agencies, such as a personal dashboard or notifications capability that offers visibility into fees owed to the government with links to repayment or forbearance options. This could reduce indebtedness, increase satisfaction with government services, and reduce time on call centers._

#### Why Bet on This?

To show why we feel this project is important, consider a hypothetical but realistic use case: a member of the public who needs to file a restraining order with the government can’t complete that task, because the forms and processes needed to successfully file that request are designed to be completed by this petitioner’s attorney, which they don’t have, and are at risk of not completing this task and endangering themselves…
Making a difference for people in situations like that is exactly the type of impact 10x is proud to pursue.

    <ul>
        <li>Most form-related products within the civil legal system were designed with lawyers in mind as the intended user base. However,  a growing portion of that user base is non-legal professionals who often lack any form of representation. This is a big problem.</li>
        <li>This space is ripe with opportunity and filled with enthusiastic stakeholders working towards the same goal. The team found engaged collaborators and potential partners.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### How it’s Going

Digital Access to Justice Platform, or as we like to call it A2J, is a great example of how the 10x process embraces change. Our project teams have the freedom to recommend pivots in project directions when new paths of delivering impact emerge over the course of phase. In this case, the initial idea that focused on resolving fines and fees didn’t feel like a winning bet for 10x. But the team did find an opportunity to help in a different way — one that was still in the spirit of the initial idea: to improve the digital experience people have with the justice system. 

What started off as an exploration into helping people resolve payments they owed to the government has now expanded to make the justice system more accessible to the public by improving court forms — so that the people who fill out these forms actually understand the content and instructions,  and can complete them without formal legal representation. We see the potential makings of a  Digital Access to Justice Platform.

The new opportunity in this space that our team will be pursuing in Phase Three during FY24 addresses a problem that our team uncovered in earlier phases: that ‘Justice forms’ are designed for lawyers, when the majority of people who interact with the system are not lawyers and do not have lawyers to represent them. 

The first use case within the court system is to deliver shared technology for facilitating online interviews for members of the public seeking legal redress. 
If successful, we’d deliver impact by helping people assemble the documents they need to advocate for themselves within the justice system, and eventually scale to other government-public interactions. 

We’ve approved this project Phase Three and can’t wait to help it succeed!

### FY23 Wins

<div class="blue-hilighted-insights">
    <p><strong>Benefits Locator Tool</strong> - Last time you heard about this project, it was a 10x project called the Benefits Eligibility Awareness Recognition Service (BEARS) that just graduated Phase Four. Since then, we have launched an interactive web app to help members of the public easily identify benefits they qualify for based on major life events. It’s now a fully operational product owned and maintained by USA.gov.</p>

### Celebrating "No"

This Impact report highlights the body and breadth of our work, and showcases select 10x investments in FY23. But we also want to call attention to those pitch ideas submitted, but not selected, for Phase 1 investigation. The Phase 1s that didn’t advance to Phase 2, and other later-phase projects that closed out before launch. 

We absolutely celebrate these as successes! Saying "No" is an expression of why our investment-style approach to funding ideas, projects and products works. If we can’t justify spending time and money, we stop, so we can shift attention and resources to projects and products that show the biggest potential, the biggest impact. 

So, yes. We celebrate "No."
