## Look Ahead to FY23

Each year, in this section of the report, we share our financial and staffing projections for FY23.

But this time, we’re not trying to predict the future in our Look Ahead section. If you’re after the numbers and graphs, check out the appendix at the end!

Instead, we wanted to hear from some of our new Delivery Team members about what they are personally excited about in the coming fiscal year.

Here’s what some of our delivery team members who joined 10x in FY22 had to say about FY23:

> &ldquo;At the very end of September, we held the first IRL (in-real-life) meeting since 10x created the delivery team. We generated a lot of new ideas for ways to improve our program that I'm excited to see develop. One idea I'm particularly excited about is **10x's commitment to establishing discipline-focused guilds for the first time in FY23.** Our program uses talent from more than five separate organizations to staff all of our projects, which means our approach to product development has been informed by the common practices and expectations within each of those organizations. Also, all of us as product managers have our own ideas based on our own experiences working in the field. The 10x product guild will allow us to codify a core group of programwide principles and practices, and I'm excited to help out.&rdquo;

> &ldquo;I joined 10x in FY22 from the private sector to work on the wicked problem of delivering transparent, accountable, rapid, capital-efficient, human-centered innovation for the public. I believe 10x has the potential to become a locus for the broader public-interest innovation community as we move into the next fiscal year, and I'm excited to be a part of that. To help us get there, we're developing disciplinary and thematic working groups, like an engineering guild and early-venture metrics group. **In FY23, we're also developing a speaker series to convene a broad array of like-minded folks** who are trying to address similar challenges, both within government and without—and I'm pumped about that.&rdquo;

> &ldquo;**In FY23, I'm most excited to continue exploring the ecosystem of a new techstack** I've been using. I spent much of FY22 on the 10x BEARS Phase Four project, and I'll likely stay on it in FY23. My main role has been building out the front-end of the benefits locator tool, which helps the public navigate government benefits information based on their life experiences. The techstack I'm most used to is React, but the resource locator tool uses a JavaScript framework called Vue.js which is new for me. Learning Vue (and Next.js, which is built on top of Vue) and getting to apply my knowledge of them on the BEARS project has been extremely rewarding for me. I'm excited to keep digging. I'll also have my eye on at least a few other 10x projects that I'm not staffed to, but find particularly compelling that we'll have ongoing in FY23. The first project that comes to mind as having huge potential is **Visualizing the Carbon Footprint, currently in Phase Three**.&rdquo;
