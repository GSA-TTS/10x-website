## 10x Dark Matter

For those of you reading a 10x Impact Report for the first time, Dark Matter is a concept we explore each year. In scientific parlance, “dark matter” refers to everything that makes up the known universe that is neither visible nor detectable by humans using available technology.

Astronomers believe that roughly 85% of the universe is made up of this mysterious phenomenon, and we know and understand very little about it.

What does this concept have to do with 10x? Well, we've borrowed the term and applied it to our field of inquiry, i.e., innovation in government technology.

To us, dark matter is the value that 10x brings to the government that isn't product-shaped. It's not the combined value of the applications, research, and APIs we deliver—it's the powerful, but shapeless, ideas we generate along the way. And we think there's a real chance that 85% of the value that 10x delivers lies within these ideas. All we have to do is uncover them.

    In order for the government to truly modernize and deliver excellent public service in the digital age, agencies don't just need better software, they need new ideas for how to tackle long-standing problems. The value of 10x isn't in the achievements or adoption of any individual product. Rather, the value of 10x is in the ideas it surfaces.

The above quote came up in a good conversation we had with a federal IT executive several years ago. It illustrates the challenge we’re addressing when looking for dark matter. And this year, the dark matter is all about good conversations, and how starting them is one of the values and unique strengths of government innovation programs.

### Overheard at 10x

Many people who work in office environments have experienced situations where minor side conversations held in the moments just before a meeting begins, or right afterwards when people are shuffling into the hallway, prove to be far more instructive and useful than any formal decisions or discussions held during the actual meeting itself.

By their very nature, these conversations are never the intended outcome of a meeting, yet their actual value is clear. Spontaneous, informal chatter sparks ideas and reveals information in a way that written agendas often can’t. People are much more willing to whisper their real thoughts to a trusted colleague after a meeting ends than they are to speak their minds in front of a big group.

These types of serendipitous encounters enable conversations. But 10x has found that technology also enables fruitful conversations. To illustrate the value technology brings to conversations, let’s return briefly to the FGR;FAC project.

The early years of the FGR project produced two functional prototypes. Like most prototypes, they validated the technical approach for feasibility, identified design flaws, and demonstrated potential value to the user with an eye towards adoption.

But looking back over the course of FGR;FAC, it has become clear that the enduring legacy of those early prototypes and research isn’t tied to adoption or incremental improvements to the user’s experience.

The most enduring impact was that it helped frame conversations within the grants community about what was possible in the massive world of grants technology. The FGR project was not the first time anyone had asked what a modern grants system could look like. Rather, our work built on the work and creativity of countless others before us. But the work we did, the demos we presented, and the open, communicative way we work helped influence conversations that ultimately led to a years-long modernization effort.

But if conversations are so valuable, why don’t government technology projects ever start with the explicit goal of sparking them?

One reason is that civil servants want guarantees that their investment is in the best interest of the public and will quickly provide favorable returns, financial or otherwise. But one of our core beliefs is that because technology is always changing, it’s risky to predict a future state and then build towards that.

No matter what else changes on the ground, it’s easy to appease decision-makers by guaranteeing that we know exactly what a technology solution will look like in two years and exactly what the return on an investment will be.

It’s far more difficult to ask for funding specifically to start conversations that could lead to interesting ideas, with no guarantees of immediate reward.

Another reason is metrics. Not only are conversations not quantifiable, but their influence isn’t always detectable even when they represent most of the value generated in a project. But the outcomes in FY22 have challenged this assumption. We are now looking for ways to show the value of evolving conversations sparked by technology innovations.

One advantage of conversations is that unlike prototypes, conversations do not need vigilant oversight and developer skills to maintain. Conversations that seemingly ended years ago can be resurrected rather easily and resumed where they left off if needed. Preserving trusted relationships between community members can have more of a long-term impact than monitoring dormant repositories for dependency upgrades.

Technology relies on formal, continuous research to influence how a project can pivot towards the most valuable path forward. But conversations can do this too, without the research or even the intent.

Conversations about big topics—like what an ideal grants technology ecosystem might be able to do—withstand changes in circumstances on the ground, compared to technical prototypes that quickly become useless when they can’t grow without constant developer support.

So what can 10x do with these insights? How do we harness the value of conversations, and contribute to them?

We’re starting with the assumption that the best way to squeeze value out of conversations is to know which conversations to start in the first place. And a good place to start is by identifying what important conversations are happening that innovation could inform. [We’ve written previously]({{ fy21-url | url }}) about the opportunity that civil servants have to bring their whole selves to work, and how that can influence our technology priorities.

In the last few years, our country has been having some very public, passionate conversations about a few topics:

- Defining and showing the importance of consent, 
- Clarifying the expectations and rights dealing with online privacy; and 
- Understanding the role that trauma plays in people’s lives.

These concepts and questions emerge during technology development in government, the same way they emerge online or in the news. We believe that technology can contribute to these conversations in meaningful ways.

### Why Government Technologists Need to Understand Trauma

_Equity-Centered Design with American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN)_  is an active 10x project in Phase Two. The goal of the project is to find ways of improving public service delivery to AI/AN populations by testing an equity-centered, collaborative design approach between civil servants, technologists, and communities.

In Phase One, our team quickly learned that a lack of trust between AI/AN populations and the federal government will be an obstacle to success for this project. This strained relationship can be attributed to this population’s experience with generational trauma from being marginalized for hundreds of years. In order to deliver success on this project, 10x is carefully considering how the role of trauma must be taken into account.

This 10x project isn’t the first time someone has wondered about the effects that trauma has on people or communities. But it’s easy for technologists to ignore these questions when building products and services. This is especially true considering that companies aren’t required to factor generational trauma into software design services for the government.

But this question does matter, and we're asking it. In fact, we see no other choice but to weave this question into our project from the very beginning.

To really deliver excellent products that solve problems, technologists have to really understand what’s going on with their users. And for public servants, who often aim to serve user groups from marginalized backgrounds, trauma matters. By choosing to include these questions in our project, we hope to contribute to hard conversations and influence how agencies serve these diverse populations for the better.

### Online Privacy and Consent

Another FY22 project we worked on that can contribute meaningfully to good conversations is our Data Locker project. The goal is to find ways to empower members of the public to have more insight into, and control over, the personal data they share with the government.

The potential product would be a digital platform that allows the public to control the use of their data. Its value would be in saving people the time and hassle to keep track of important documents and to report the information these documents contain over and over to different parts of the government.

For example, someone applying for public benefits offered by multiple agencies may need to submit the same personal financial information to each agency individually.

Bringing this capability to the government would be a big win. But we think contributing to the conversation around expectations of online privacy and consent could be bigger.

In the world of big data, people are growing anxious over what data about them is out there and how it’s being used. A product like a Data Locker would show that the government takes digital consent and privacy seriously. It could also influence the expectations around the exchange and use of personal data in the private sector—from social media monitoring to online ad trackers and more.

### The Essential Role of Government Innovators in Starting Conversations

10x believes that innovation hubs within federal agencies are uniquely positioned to contribute to the types of hard conversations society is having. Why innovators? Because we have

- an experimental outlook, 
- a focus on identifying and solving hard problems, and 
- a willingness to embrace unknown outcomes.

If we can launch projects explicitly to start hard conversations, government innovation programs could move the needle of trust in government. If public servants accounted for the role that trauma plays in peoples’ lives into their work, then technology could help influence these conversations for years to come. For this reason, we believe that it is critical for federal agencies to continue supporting innovation initiatives. That’s an important conversation to have.
