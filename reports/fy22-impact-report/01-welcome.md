## Letter from the Team
**Welcome to the 10x Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Impact Report!**

This is the sixth year in a row that we’ve published our annual impact report. As always, we’ll start with a letter from the team.

This year, team means something a bit different to us. The team behind this year’s letter is a whole lot bigger and looks a whole lot different than the team who wrote last year’s letter. By the end of FY22, we had enough staff to fill a medium-sized conference room. We know this because we hosted an IRL (in real life) meeting, and every seat was taken. We learned a lot during the 10x IRL, including that at least one of us can carry a tune.

But something we knew already—because we carefully selected for it while expanding the team—is that we all are dedicated to innovating for the public good. It’s this fact that has always animated the 10x team, whenever and whatever the size.

Innovating for the public good can be challenging. But thorny challenges can also bring teams together, and that’s exactly what we saw during FY22.

One challenge we faced was resurrecting projects that 10x had funded that had gone cold, but then suddenly found new relevance. Twice during FY22, the government renewed its interest in government technology areas where 10x has already invested significant time and energy:

- a government-wide notifications service
- grants modernization

We jumped at the chance to resurface what we learned and built to help out with these new efforts. As an added benefit, revisiting those projects revealed a need for our team to think through and develop a consistent process for revisiting old projects that had either graduated or fizzled out from 10x previously. We expect (and hope) that opportunities to revisit old projects will come around again, and when they do we’d like to have a playbook for how to do that most effectively.

We’ll explain how and why we revived these older projects. We’ll also cover developments on other 10x projects, hear directly from some 10x delivery team members, and explore some of the ideas we’ve developed over the last year through 10x dark matter.

We hope this report will convey some of the impact we’ve delivered for the public over the last year and inspire civil servants everywhere to believe in the value of their own ideas.

Sincerely,

The Newer—and Bigger —10x Team
