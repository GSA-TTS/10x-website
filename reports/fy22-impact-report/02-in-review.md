## FY22 in Review 

We sum up 10x's FY22 in three sentences: We grew a lot. Our projects achieved a lot of milestones. And through the American Rescue Plan, we delivered results.

Here's what we did:

### A growing team.

At the beginning of FY22, we had fewer than 10 full-time team members.  By year's end we had more than double that number. That's a lot of growth and change in a short amount of time. Before FY22, we staffed our projects with talented technologists from outside our own program, either from elsewhere in government or from the private sector.

But in FY22, we stood up an internal team of technologists, added staff to the 10x program management office, and welcomed new U.S. Digital Corps Fellows to our roster.

As most people working in government know, rapidly standing up an entire team within one fiscal year is no small feat.

We had toyed with the idea of building an internal delivery team for years, rather than relying exclusively on staffing from external sources. There were a few reasons we'd been thinking about this for so long.

First, we wanted to streamline the process to get our projects moving more quickly. One challenge of relying on external staffing is that the demand for talented technologists in government outstrips the supply. This meant that 10x was only one team of many looking for staff from the same talent pools.

Developing an internal staffing model brought us more predictable and reliable access to the talent we need. Bringing our technologists in-house will also help build institutional knowledge. It's always better when the same team can work on the project throughout its lifecycle.

Embedding more talent within our program will allow us to increase the number of projects we're able to explore. Embedding talent makes it easier and faster to staff our projects. Now we can avoid the hassle of assembling new teams with new paperwork on each project, and sometimes even between project phases.

Second, having a dedicated delivery team reduces the burden of navigating financial agreements with our various service providers. These agreements take time and can delay projects. Saving time here is particularly important when projects are between phases, because an extended lull in work saps momentum and dampens partner enthusiasm.

Third, an internal delivery team helps us maintain consistent team structures on projects over the project's multiphase life cycle. In the past, we've faced situations where an entire project team turned over between a project's phases. These transitions disrupt the project vision, personal connections with stakeholders, and established team norms.

Finally, we felt that bringing more talent in-house would keep our projects fresh. With our previous staffing model, once a project finished, the staff would be reassigned to other work, often non-10x projects. If a completed project got noticed or inquiries came in, no one could answer the phone because the people closest to the work had already moved on.

With permanent staff, we'll have someone with firsthand project experience available even after a project is complete.

### Project Successes.

"What do bears and pets have in common?"

If you were thinking, "They're both animals," then you'd be wrong. The answer is that they're both 10x projects. Many of our projects have delivered results in FY22, but we'll highlight two: BEARS and PETs.

<p class="text-bold">Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service (BEARS)</p>

The BEARS project helps the government meet people where they are. BEARS helps the public learn about government benefits they may be eligible for based on their life events. For example, a survivor of a natural disaster may be eligible for services like financial aid for home repairs or certain types of tax relief. But completely different agencies offer these benefits. And uncovering what benefits are out there, who's eligible for them, and how to apply can be confusing and time consuming.

The problem? This situation burdens people in vulnerable situations. At a difficult time, they have to navigate complex governmental bureaucracies when they need help the most.

We believe that saving people time — the hours it would take to navigate different agency web portals and FAQ pages — could let them do what they really want to do: grieve and recover during hard times. If innovation might help reduce this burden, then it was worth a 10x investment.

<span class="text-bold">In FY22, we're closing the project after four successful phases.</span> Through the BEARS project, 10x developed a benefits locator tool in beta that covers a loved one's death. We've handed off the tech stack and responsibility to our capable partners at USAGov. They will continue to scale the benefits locator tool into the future.

And when they do, they'll be sure to include some nice occasions too, like giving birth or retiring. For more on BEARS, see the description on our projects page. To find the benefits locator tool in action, visit usa.gov.

<p class="text-bold">Deploying Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)</p>

As we continue to deepen our investment in promising emerging technologies, we are particularly excited about work we funded this year around the deployment of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). PETs are a suite of techniques that allow people to gain insight from sensitive data without having access to the data itself.

To understand the potential of these capabilities, imagine a future where a researcher could ask a question on granular, person-level data without ever accessing that dataset. This would allow the researcher to gain insights while still maintaining and in some cases increasing the privacy of the people that data describes.

We believe that these techniques are poised to fundamentally shift much of how the government (and beyond) thinks about, uses, and gains insights from data. FY22 saw an <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Executive Order around Advancing a Vision for Privacy Enhancing Technologies (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/06/28/advancing-a-vision-for-privacy-enhancing-technologies/">Executive Order around Advancing a Vision for Privacy Enhancing Technologies</a> and a <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Fast Track Action Committee (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nitrd.gov/coordination-areas/privacy-rd/appdsa/">Fast Track Action Committee</a> to develop a cohesive national strategy to advance privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics.

We're proud to fund <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Census xD (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.xd.gov/">xD</a>, an emerging technologies group at the U.S. Census Bureau, for this project which is currently in Phase Three. In FY22, they represented the U.S. in an international collaboration of statistical agencies as part of the newly formed United Nations Privacy Enhancing Technologies Lab.

As part of this, they are deploying an open source platform to query a network of open data without "seeing" it as a way to test technical viability, business value, potential policy/governance implications, and infrastructural challenges. This also includes learning and testing things like how cloud-native, zero trust applications might also be applied and what use cases across government are starting to show themselves as a result of these tests.

If the pilot proves that PETs adoption in government is both technically feasible and valuable, then this project will show the potential scalability of utilizing PETs for the public good.

### American Rescue Plan.

<p class="text-italic">On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law. This $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package is designed to boost the country's recovery from the severe economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to addressing the public health and economic crises, the ARP provides funding to modernize technology and improve cybersecurity across the federal government. The fund that makes 10x possible is called the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF). The FCSF received $150 million as part of the ARP to support government-wide citizen-facing services. Some of that funding came to 10x. We want to be open and transparent about how we are using these funds  and will cover some of the projects we supported in FY22 using ARP funding.</p>

<p class="text-bold">Identity Alerts for Government</p>

The federal government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding the eligibility criteria for many existing social safety net programs and created new ways for struggling Americans to get help when they needed it most.

Unfortunately, swindlers, grifters, fraudsters, criminals, troublemakers, and scammers took opportunities to benefit from the expanded government assistance. Fraud and identity theft increased exponentially. Identity theft and benefit claims fraud resulted in millions of people suffering financial hardship and the stress of cleaning up their stolen identities — all during a global pandemic.

10x is looking into developing an Identity Alert Service that will allow members of the public to voluntarily sign up to receive notifications when their personal information is used to apply for government services and benefits. This service will build trust and strengthen social safety net programs across the government. It can also help prevent fraud, and could scale to use cases beyond submitting applications for benefits.

10x chose to fund this project out of ARP funding because we saw the direct relationship between what this project could achieve and what the ARP is all about:

Our work is:

- directly related to the pandemic recovery, 
- could benefit from other 10x efforts (including U.S. Notify, described below), 
- would create a better customer experience for the public, and 
- helps reimagine government service delivery, which is one of the guiding principles that TTS holds to in releasing ARP funds for investment.

<p class="text-italic">Identity Alerts for Government is ongoing in Phase Two.</p>

<p class="text-bold">U.S. Notify</p>

Most people get easily accessible communications from the companies whose products they use:

- An SMS message from a bank asking to confirm a large purchase.
- A responsive customer service team that answers email inquiries within one business day.
- Alerts from a telecom provider letting you know about pre-approved available phone upgrades.

Unfortunately, government communications often fall short of their private sector counterparts. This service gap has a disproportionate impact on low income families and individuals.

A good example is in the administration of public benefit programs like SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, and Unemployment Insurance. To the frustration of many, local governments that administer benefits programs are rarely able to easily update people on their application's status. Agencies also struggle to let people know about new services they may be eligible for, like disaster assistance or extended unemployment insurance.

We believe the government should be able to notify the public about things that matter to them, in a way that meets them where they are.

One of 10x's latest efforts was exploring a multi-channel (SMS, email, etc.) notifications platform intended for use by agencies across the government. During the summer of 2022, there was a lot of support for this idea at TTS, and we were encouraged to find the best place for TTS to contribute.

In late 2022, U.S. Notify graduated 10x at Phase Three as a functional product that sends SMS messages. We ended this project at Phase Three because we found a place for it to live and thrive: the Public Benefits Studio within TTS.

That team will own and develop U.S. Notify further and is actively recruiting customers.

<p class="text-bold">Some Background</p>

In 2018, 10x funded a project called Notifications-as-a-Service. The project got through Phase Two, but we didn't fund the project for Phase Three because the timing wasn't quite right.

But the landscape changed in the four years in between, and in 2022 TTS was ready to explore ideas for new shared services. All the research and prototyping that we've done in this space became newly relevant. We used it to build and successfully test a messaging capability.

We handed off U.S. Notify to the TTS Public Benefits Studio, a new team within TTS that collaborates with benefits agencies to build shared technology tools and spread best practices to simplify the public experience of navigating public benefits programs. The Public Benefits Studio will continue to sustain and grow the notifications U.S. Notify Into the future.
