## Look Ahead to FY22

We’re 100% convinced that FY22 is going to be busy, exciting, and challenging. We have projects advancing into technology we’ve never worked with before. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to multiply our impact by funding more work than ever. And new doors have opened that can help scale and support our projects post-10x when the projects complete Phase Four. Here are a few things we’re expecting to come across over the next 365 days and how we’re thinking about them:

#### Scaling and Multiplying

Two things will be important for us in FY22:

- First, the [American Rescue Plan (ARP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/) will be significant for 10x in FY22.
- Second, we’re expecting to clone our own model and help other agencies replicate something similar to 10x within their organizations.

Our organization — the Technology Transformation Services — received [ARP funding](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/tts-american-rescue-plan/tts-american-rescue-plan-projects-and-impact) specifically to recover, rebuild, and reimagine digital public service delivery in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. 10x will use some of these funds to reimagine digital public service delivery, which happens to be something we’re particularly good at.

With this TTS ARP support, we’ll fund more work across phases to experiment with and uncover new opportunities for how small improvements can provide a huge impact for the government’s response to COVID-19.

- our projects align specifically to the spirit of the TTS ARP, and/or
- require significant financial advancement to deliver impact beyond what 10x can provide in Phase Four.

Joining forces with the TTS ARP PMO will make our work even more impactful. If they are considering work that may have potential, but is unproven, we will take the lead,  putting it through our investment phases. We can identify this work’s potential and viability, before our parent organization considers this work for more substantial support.

We want to formally pursue a goal we’ve had for years: helping other organizations in government spin-up initiatives that harness what we’ve learned and use some of our methods. To do that, we’re actively talking to multiple federal agencies who want to work with us to recreate our model in their organization. We will help these other agencies, but also recognize that the agency partners will have to do the real work:

- Finding funding,
- Finding a safe space to operate within their agency’s bureaucracy, and
- Getting buy-in from leadership for standing up a 10x-like process.

These steps won’t be easy, but we'll help all we can. We also recognize that there is always room for improvement. We know there are opportunities to do things differently while keeping our basic risk-mitigation, iterative model intact.

We fully expect these initiatives in other agencies will differ from our program, since they will need to be tailored to fit the funding, culture, and IT environments in other agencies.
