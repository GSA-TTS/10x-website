## The Dark Matter

In order for the government to truly modernize and deliver excellent public service in the digital age, agencies don’t just need better software, they need new ideas for how to tackle long-standing problems.

### The challenge

10x inherits GSA’s vision of an effective and efficient government. To play our part in helping make that a reality, we need to keep our finger on the pulse of developments, challenges, and opportunities in the govtech space. With that in mind, about a year ago, the 10x team met with top federal IT executives and colleagues to discuss projects we were hoping to evangelize and make connections for, while also learning about the technology challenges and opportunities they see for their agencies. We gain invaluable intelligence and inspiration from these colleagues that helps guide our investment strategy.

_“The value of 10x isn’t in the achievements or adoption of any individual product. Rather, the value of 10x is in the ideas we surface. **In order for the government to truly modernize and deliver excellent public service in the digital age, agencies don’t just need better software, they need new ideas for how to tackle long-standing problems.”**_
~ Shared by Federal IT Executive

What they’re suggesting is that we need to produce value not just in the form of _technology_, but also in _innovation_—new ideas about how the federal government can do tech differently. This is the challenge that 10x chose to take on, and this is where the concept 10x dark matter comes in. Dark Matter represents the innovations that 10x discovers that aren’t product-shaped. For this year’s Dark Matter, we’re going to explore ideas that are largely drawn on our [Shared Components for Museums and Libraries project](../../projects/shared-components-for-museums-and-libraries/).

### The Innovation

**This year, one of the most exciting innovations we found is the possibility of applying Internet of Things capabilities to public service in creative new ways.**

We found these opportunities quite unexpectedly, and we assume there are more.

Two concepts are key to understanding this year’s dark matter content.

First is the _digital divide_, which refers to how different populations face gaps in access to technology. Factors like income, age, and geographical location can determine where a person falls on the digital divide.

People who are less-connected face a number of disadvantages, including difficulty participating in the digital economy. A practical and timely example are the challenges people without reliable internet access faced in adapting to life during COVID-19, like shifting to remote work and remote schooling.

Many levels of government have tried to solve, **or bridge, the digital divide for years. 10x believes this area has great potential for innovation.**

The second concept is the _Internet of Things_, or IoT. IoT is a rapidly-expanding field of technology based on networks of physical devices that can receive and send information over the internet, often with embedded software or sensors. Good examples of IoT technology include smart home devices, like WiFi-enabled thermostats.

In the public sector, existing IoT uses include sensor-driven traffic control and waste management systems in city and municipal governments. But in general, current applications of IoT within the _federal_ government cluster around internal agency operations, such as:

- supply chain management,
- inventory tracking,
- facilities access, and
- various security and surveillance uses.

Some agencies use IoT to monitor climate and ecosystems environmental sensors. But mostly, IoT capabilities across the federal government focus on improving agencies’ internal operations. We don’t have many recorded instances of federal agencies using IoT to directly meet their mission in a way that is public-facing.

In addition, most of these technologies were acquired by procuring commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products from software vendors. The few agencies that have built IoT capabilities in-house did so because the commercial solutions were not available for their specific business needs.

Our work last year stands out among federal government use cases of IoT, because we use it in a direct, mission-delivery way. Our innovations can help bridge the digital divide.

**As far as we know, our work is the first technology project in the federal government that**

- **developed in-house IoT capabilities,**
- **used open-source software that is compatible with inexpensive and readily available open-source hardware,**
- **neither collects nor stores sensitive information, and**
- **is freely available and documented on the web for anyone to use.**

The best part is that our user base is librarians embedded in communities across the country who can use our IoT technology to make data-informed decisions that benefit their patrons.

And if that _isn’t_ the best part, then the best part is that we discovered a new way of getting disconnected folks online along the way. We helped the government reimagine ways to bridge the digital divide.

### The Project

The project started as an exploration into the possibility of developing reusable, open-source digital components for Social Safety Net benefits programs.

It changed into a project looking at shared components for museums and libraries.

We shifted our focus when our research clearly showed the critical role that libraries have played helping people access technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also helped that a strong federal agency with relevant subject-matter expertise agreed to work with us.

We soon discovered that a key problem that libraries face is understanding the details of their patrons’ WiFi usage.

Many libraries provide WiFi access, a key resource that allows people to apply for jobs or unemployment benefits when they lack access at home. Having data on WiFi usage helps libraries make budget decisions and influences when they offer WiFi services.

First, we produced a new way for libraries to collect data on WiFi usage. The IoT technology we developed includes open-source code that runs on open-source hardware, acting as a sensor that collects and transmits data on WiFi usage within libraries. It includes details on peak times of usage, the number of connected devices, and duration of visits.

Also, it provides baseline, structured data that will allow libraries to track changes in Wifi usage year-after-year, or even day-by-day. The data can also be exchanged with other granting and policy agencies at the state or federal levels.

More than 20 local libraries across the country use the prototype devices we developed. Our technology

- saves libraries time and money,
- replaces paper-based processes,
- is decentralized (libraries can use the tools completely independently of 10x or federal involvement), and
- mitigates agency concerns about privacy by not collecting any sensitive information.

Second, we developed a novel hotspot capability completely by accident. Our engineers found that the open-source software stack we built serves as a WiFi hotspot when connected to a USB cellular modem, with minor modifications to the source code. We believe this technology could scale for use in schools, community centers, and other places where the digital divide is widest. Stumbling upon innovations by accident speaks to the magic of the 10x process: embrace unknown outcomes, be open to pivoting, unleash smart people on thorny problems. Magic.

The last — and perhaps most important — demonstrated value from our work is that it’s worth the government’s while to look for new, better ways to ensure that people on both sides of the divide can benefit from emerging trends in technology.

To many people, WiFi-controlled robotic vacuum cleaners and smart refrigerators are out of reach. Internal federal agency operation-focused implementations of IoT feel a bit removed from direct public service and are unlikely to deliver tangible benefits to individual members of the public.

Our project hasn't solved the digital divide, but it shows how our program is addressing a complex problem in society through innovation. We’ve proven that the federal government can play a constructive role to ensure that the public is able to benefit from the latest technologies that are transforming everyday life. We can find innovative ways to harness them ethically, securely, in the open, and always in the pursuit of excellent public service.

From our perspective, the solutions we offer prove there are viable, innovative IoT applications in the federal government that have not been explored before. After all, we never set out to “do an IoT project”. We landed on this approach by chance, and only through thorough research and prototyping. With further investment and experimentation, we believe federal agencies can uncover many more IoT applications.
