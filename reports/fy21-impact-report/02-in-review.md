## FY21 in Review 

<div class="grid-row">
  <div class="mobile:grid-col-12 desktop:grid-col-6">
    <p>We’ve funded hundreds of projects over the years and we always encourage our teams to practice good agile hygiene. The retrospective (or ‘retro’ as it’s commonly called)  is a critical part of the agile development process. That’s when a team pauses after a development sprint (usually every two weeks) to look back and examine what went well, what didn’t go well. We explore how to improve things moving forward. Practicing what we preach, we've conducted a mega-retro to examine what went well and didn’t go well over the last year. Here are our main takeaways:</p>

### Where we succeeded

For most of our history, we’ve used what we call the “everything bagel approach” to source the types of ideas we want to invest in. This approach meant we left the market wide open and accepted ideas across every topic in government technology you can think of, including contracting, cybersecurity, robotic process automation (RPA), etc.

In FY21, we did something different. We moved away from the “everything bagel approach” and  defined a few specific areas of the government technology ecosystem where we were particularly interested in exploring. We called these areas investment themes. Defining the types of projects where we wanted to invest allowed us to set up parameters for the ideas we wanted to target and center our outreach accordingly. The first themes we chose were <span class="text-italic">Public Trust and Civic Life, Equity in Delivery</span>, and <span class="text-italic">Public Lands and the Environment</span>. 

Why these themes? In order to serve the public, we need to understand what matters to the public. And one of the great privileges of being in the civil service is that we are able to bring our whole selves to our work: both as civil servants and as members of the public. After all, we live in communities, we talk with friends and neighbors, and we read the news just like everyone else. In other words, we get to wear two hats at once. We hear what people discuss and what matters to them, and we feel that our themes address topics (like low trust in government and concerns about our changing natural environment) that the public will recognize as timely and directly relevant to their lives.

That change succeeded and worked in our favor for a few reasons:

First, defining themes made outreach easier. For example, when we made <span class="text-italic">Public Lands and the Environment</span> a theme, we immediately knew where to look for great ideas: federal agencies that work to protect and study the environment.

Second, defining themes allowed us to develop important contacts and map the who’s who of certain problem spaces in government technology. One of our challenges on new 10x projects is figuring out where to start and who to talk with first. By moving towards this structure, we’ve built strong contacts with subject-matter experts who we can easily consult on projects relevant to their expertise.

Third, having themes made it easier to compare different ideas during our evaluation periods. For example, it’s easier to debate the merits and opportunities of two ideas that take different angles on climate challenges than it is to compare the merits of a cybersecurity idea to an acquisitions idea.  

Lastly, and most importantly, having defined themes allowed us to align our program’s investment portfolio with topics that matter to the public.

### Where we shined

For government program managers, one of the best confidence boosters is when our work happens to align well with administration-level priorities.

One area where we really excelled last year was finding areas of significant overlap between what our projects are doing and what the new Administration wants to do. Many of our FY21 projects directly supported legislation and/or government-wide priorities, such as

- [CASES Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1079),
- [21st Century IDEA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text),
- and the [Executive Order on racial justice](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).

Another success was advancing projects that build products that the public can use. In the past, many projects delivered back-end software for agencies or guidance for federal employees.

But this past year, as a program within GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS), we’ve been focusing more on public-facing work that helps drive TTS’ vision to create trusted modern government experiences for all. If we’re delivering products that support legislation and other priorities — while building things that the public will use directly — we know we’re on the right track.

One example is our Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service (BEARS) team work on <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder">Benefit Finder</a>. The BEARS app we’re building will not only help people find and apply for benefits more easily, but it will also add compassion and empathy to public service by centering benefits information around the life events that trigger people to search for benefits, such as a death in the family or losing a home in a natural disaster. Centering benefits around life events rather than agency silos demonstrates that the government understands the needs of the public, which is critical to building trust between public and government. We believe the best time for compassionate and empathetic public service is when people are grieving, or trying to rebuild their lives after a tragedy.

We’ve been working with new technologies in ways we haven’t before. For years, APIs, data products, playbooks, and websites were our bread and butter.

No longer. Keep reading to see how we’re engaging with emerging technologies, like privacy engineering and the Internet of Things (IoT).

### Challenges we faced

At 10x, we’re lucky to have flexibility in deciding what projects we take on. Our uniquely iterative investment approach identifies risks and allows us to end projects when it’s clear they won’t deliver impact. The challenge this model presents to us is that sometimes we need to close down projects we love. Certain projects pull at our heartstrings, but if the evidence does not point to their successful exit, then the responsible decision is to end the project. 

Other times, projects do have a viable path towards success, but because we don’t have unlimited funding, we are forced to make hard decisions about which projects should move forward from one phase to another. We’re trained to make the most of what we have and to work within these constraints. Having a limited number of projects we can invest in forces us to think more critically about funding decisions. We always have to ask ourselves: will this project deliver value?

Bringing passion into our projects is key to their successful outcomes. But when it comes to making objective funding decisions, we have to be, well, objective. And that requires asking tough questions and making hard choices. Some of the most common reasons we end projects we love is because our partner agencies may not be equipped – or ready – to take them on and maintain them sustainably.

In government, budgets are often planned out two years in advance. But 10x develops products more quickly than that. The problem this presents is that when we are working with an agency that wants to own one of our solutions, they may not have access to the financial liquidity that it will take to own the product long-term. Another challenge we face is that hiring in government often takes time, and many agencies have not yet built a large pool of engineers, product managers, and other technical talent to leverage on new initiatives. These resource constraints make it difficult to transition our projects to partner agencies. While we do face these staffing challenges regularly, there is increased momentum in government to prioritize bringing on top notch technical talent into the civil workforce. A good example is the US Digital Corps program – hosted by GSA - that matches early career technologists with government agencies. We believe this and other initiatives focusing on developing  a digital civil service will help a great deal with these types of challenges. 

To mitigate these risks, we try to be as up front and transparent with our partners as possible when it comes to the resources that will be required to own a solution. Recognizing the critical importance of meeting people where they are and working with (not for) our partners means we can channel a project into a direction that fully aligns with our agency partners’ capabilities. This is a challenge, but it’s one that 10x is mindful of and committed to solving  for, as soon as we see it on the horizon.

But occasionally, even when our teams and our partner agencies are excited about a project and see how much impact it could deliver, we need to end the project early when the hand-off feels too risky. And when we do that, it is always with a heavy heart.
