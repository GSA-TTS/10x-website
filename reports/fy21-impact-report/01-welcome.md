## Letter from the Team
**Welcome to the 10x Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) Impact Report!**

2021 has been an eventful year for the world, the country, and our small but mighty 10x team. Although faced with uncertainty around the pandemic, transitioning to a new administration, and shifting budget priorities, we never lost our focus: invest in and experiment on federal employees’ technology ideas and see if they work.  As always, we want to radically improve how the government uses technology innovation to serve the public.

Each fiscal year, we try to identify new trends across our projects that can help us understand our own growth and maturity as a program.

Last year, we saw an exciting trend: across our portfolio, our projects were moving from delivering prototypes to shipping live, active products. These products were dashboards, new forms components, benefits screeners, and APIs. They solved real problems. The impact was recognized by our peers and the market.

This year, we identified a new pattern:  we’ve become fully immersed in new frontiers of technology exploration. We’re not just experimenting with technologies that are relatively unknown to the government, but we’re actively developing these dynamic new technologies. We’re preparing the government to approach, adopt, and use these technologies for public good.

We’ve met inspiring people fighting the good innovation fight and making things happen in — and for — government more than ever before. Thank you to our supporters and fellow innovators who create space for programs like 10x to exist. And, special thank you to the record number of federal employees who submitted ideas to 10x over the last year. We can’t make an impact without you.

Sincerely,
