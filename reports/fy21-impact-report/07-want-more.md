## Want more from 10x? Let’s Talk


If you’ve made it this far, we hope we have your attention, and your imagination. Here are a few opportunities for collaboration that we’d love to explore with you and your organization:

Are you interested in exploring dark matter with us? If you or your agency has found a novel application of IoT that is directly tied to mission-delivery in a public-facing way, we’d love to hear about it.

Last year’s dark matter focused on the opportunities for government and third sector organizations (like non-profits and academia) to co-design, build, and manage software together to deliver impact for the public in a way that leverages the relative strengths and capabilities of government and non-government. If you have come across an arrangement like this — or are interested in exploring one — reach out!

Have any of the projects we’ve covered in this report resonated with you? If you’re interested in learning more about any of our products, or believe you can contribute to them, then don’t be shy.

Shoot us an email at <10x@gsa.gov>. And check our site regularly for more updates on upcoming and current projects.

Happy Innovating
The 10x Team
