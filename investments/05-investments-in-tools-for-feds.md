<p class="usa-intro">  
  Government websites and apps have an obligation to the public to provide useful and usable information to help them find the information they need.
</p>

However, like most other digital ecosystems, those of the federal government emerged from agency silos. To ensure a consistent, usable, accessible federal digital experience, a new foundation needs to be built.

10x has been working to create a consistent foundation for many years, and has built many of the technologies and guidance that are now relied upon across the federal space to ensure that newly built (or re-built!) sites and applications are optimized for the public. Key tools, founded by 10x, allow agencies to build sites with confidence, and 10x continues to work in this area, finding new ways to help designers and developers move quickly and confidently.

## Check out some of our projects designed to create high-quality digital experiences for the American public:

### <span>cloud.gov</span> Pages

It is really inefficient for each federal agency to have to figure out how to host secure websites. 10x built <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloud.gov/pages">cloud.gov Pages</a> (formerly Federalist) to allow agencies to quickly launch attractive, secure, and accessible public websites. 

### <span>Code.gov</span>

Open source code is a great way to save money and time by reusing code that has already been developed and tested. 10x created <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://code.gov/">Code.gov</a> to help agency partners and developers find and use open source code.

### De-risking government technology

Tech failures are frequently in the news, but they aren't inevitable. 10x developed De-risking Guides (one for federal audiences and one for state), to provide actionable guidance on the realities of development and how to deliver successful custom tech. Learn about our work <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/de-risking-guide/' | url }}">De-risking government tech projects</a>.

### Forms platform

Federal agencies face high costs and inefficiencies when transitioning to digital forms. 10x has developed an <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://federalist-9ab3a388-1535-4bd5-a4bf-04c7933172d6.sites.pages.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-tts/forms/demo/">affordable shared service</a> that simplifies digital form creation, ensuring compliance and a consistent user experience, while reducing costs for federal teams.

### Low-code/no-code

Inexpensive and marketed as easy-to-use, low-code/no-code (LC/NC) tools are attractive to many agencies. 10x <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/low-code-no-code/' | url }}">looked at the LC/NC ecosystem</a> and what type of guidance might be needed for agencies to make good decisions about whether LC/NC is right for them.

### Paperwork Reduction Act compliance

The Paperwork Reduction Act (1995) governs how federal agencies collect information from the American people. 10x developed a website on PRA with guidance on how to navigate the process of getting clearance to interact with the American public. Learn more about the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://pra.digital.gov/">Paperwork Reduction Act guidance</a>.

### Site Scanning

Federal websites are a key way the American people interact with the government, and ensuring those websites are optimized is important to ensuring this experience is successful. 10x <a class="usa-link" href="{{ '/news/site-scanning/' | url }}">designed and built a scanning service</a> to provide <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://digital.gov/guides/site-scanning/">real-time intelligence on website performance</a>.

### U.S. Web Design System

Well-designed and accessible websites are the foundation of good digital communication. 10x designed and built the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), which provides reusable components, templates, patterns, and tokens, along with guidance to ensure websites are usable and accessible across the federal space. Explore <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">USWDS</a>.

### Web performance optimization for federal websites

Many government websites suffer from slow load times, unresponsive designs, and poor visual stability, especially under poor connectivity or on lower-end devices. 10x is developing reusable design and development strategies and a performance tool tailored to federal teams to make government websites faster and more reliable.
