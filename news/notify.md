<p class="usa-intro">  
    Imagine the potential impact of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments using text messages to communicate alerts, notifications, and reminders to the public.
</p>

Over the course of multiple phases and investments, 10x built and then handed off "Government Notification Services," a text message-based notifications technology to TTS's Public Benefits Studio. Since then, the Benefits Studio has scaled and refined the 10x solution into a full-fledged shared services platform, now called <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://beta.notify.gov/">Notify.gov</a>. 

Notify facilitates communication between federal, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government agencies and program participants through text messaging. 

Notify is being tested and used by pilot partners across different federal and SLTT governments for notifications like fraud alerts, severe weather notifications, and benefit recertification reminders. This widespread adoption demonstrates the effectiveness and potential impact of Notify across various governmental tiers, and marks  a significant achievement within its first year of deployment via TTS's Public Benefits Studio.
