<p class="usa-intro">  
    Enhancing digital experiences on government websites by empowering federal digital teams with real-time intelligence
</p>

Developed by 10x over four phases, the <a class="usa-link" rel="noreferrer" href="https://digital.gov/guides/site-scanning/">Site Scanning</a>> platform offers real-time intelligence to help agencies improve website performance and compliance with government mandates by providing web managers with a customizable, automated scanning service. By reducing manual work and promoting user-centric design and content decisions, Site Scanning benefits both web managers and the public by enhancing digital experiences on government websites. 

The project draws on extensive user research and collaboration with existing web analysis tools and engineering efforts. In post-10x life, Site Scanning is maintained by GSAâ€™s Technology Transformation Services (TTS), and is scaling  to support a broader user base, including non-technical users. The Site Scanning capability joins many other impactful assets that TTS offers and operates, alongside the likes of the <a class="usa-link" rel="noreferrer" href="{{ '/news/us-web-design-system/' | url }}">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> and the <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" href="https://digital.gov/guides/dap/">Digital Analytics Program (DAP)</a>.
