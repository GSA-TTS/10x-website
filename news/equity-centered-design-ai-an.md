    Engagement through an equity-centered framework can help federal agencies shift from "design for" to "design with"
</p>

Over three phases of investment, 10x explored whether creating an equity-centered design (ECD) framework and guidance could help agencies address challenges of working with American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) communities and other underrepresented groups. 

The basic idea is that in traditional user research and design practices, the power is ultimately with the designers rather than those who use or are impacted by the product of the design. Despite best intentions, sometimes the result is services that are human-centered, but not particularly equitable in delivery. An equity-centered process/framework calls for a shift in the approach from a traditional "design for" mentality to a "design with" ethos, meaning federal designers center the wants, needs, and expertise of Tribal communities. 

While no one expected that building trust with Tribal communities would be easy, the 10x researchers found that the time needed to build trust was even more significant than predicted. It also became clear that each of the current 574 Tribes required their own frameworks that addressed their protocols, customs, and needs.  

It became clear that given the project's aim for substantial and lasting collaboration with Tribal communities, this work required resources beyond what 10x's current funding structure can effectively provide. 

Despite practical concerns and the recommendation to not proceed with further funding, 10x emphasizes the importance of adopting ECD methods when working with Tribes or marginalized communities. 10x is committed to supporting other efforts to solve this complex problem by making this project's findings, insights and recommendations available to other federal teams taking on this challenge, such as "Improving Government Digital Service Delivery to the U.S. Territories."
