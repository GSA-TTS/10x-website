subtitle: How do we provide a consistent and quality digital experience for the American public?
description: Digital websites and applications have an obligation to the American people to provide useful and usable information to help them find the information they need. However, like most other digital ecosystems, those of the federal government emerged from agency silos. To ensure a consistent, usable, accessible federal digital experience, a new foundation needs to be built.

  Digital websites and applications have an obligation to the American people to provide useful and usable information to help them find the information they need. However, like most other digital ecosystems, those of the federal government emerged from agency silos. To ensure a consistent, usable, accessible federal digital experience, a new foundation needs to be built.

  10x has been working to create a consistent foundation for many years, and has built many of the technologies and guidance that are now relied upon across the federal space to ensure that newly built (or re-built!) sites and applications are optimized for the public. Key tools, founded by 10x, allow agencies to build sites with confidence, and 10x continues to work in this area, finding new ways to help designers and developers move quickly and confidently.

  projects: 
    - subtitle: Code.gov
      text: Open source code is a great way to save money and time by reusing code that has already been developed and tested. 10x created code.gov to help agency partners and developers find and use open source code.

    - subtitle: De-risking government technology
      text: Tech failures are frequently in the news, but they aren’t inevitable. 10x developed De-Risking Guides (one for federal audiences and one for state), to provide actionable guidance on the realities of development and how to deliver successful custom tech.

    - subtitle: Federalist
      subtitle2: (now cloud.gov Pages)
      text: It is really inefficient for each federal agency to have to figure out how to host secure websites. 10x built Federalist (now cloud.gov Pages) to allow agencies to quickly launch attractive, secure, and accessible public websites.
      linkText: See cloud.gov Pages
      link_url: https://pages.cloud.gov/
    - subtitle: Low-code/no-code
      text: Inexpensive and marketed as easy-to-use, low-code/no-code (LC/NC) tools are attractive to many agencies. 10x looked at the LC/NC ecosystem and what type of guidance might be needed for agencies to make good decisions about whether LC/NC is right for them.
    - subtitle: Paperwork Reduction Act compliance
      text: The Paperwork Reduction Act (1995) governs how federal agencies collect information from the American people. 10x developed a website on PRA with guidance on how to navigate the process of getting clearance to interact with the American public.
      linkText: See Paperwork Reduction Act guidance
      link_url: https://pra.digital.gov/
    - subtitle: Site Scanner
      text: Federal websites are a key way the American people interact with the government, and ensuring those websites are optimized is important to ensuring this experience is successful. 10x designed and built a scanning service to provide real-time intelligence on website performance.
    - subtitle: U.S. Web Design System
      text: Well-designed and accessible websites are the foundation of good digital communication. 10x designed and built the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), which provides reusable components, templates, patterns, and tokens, along with guidance to ensure websites are usable and accessible across the federal space.
