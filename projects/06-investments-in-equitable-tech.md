title: Investments in equitable tech
subtitle: How can we ensure that modern government technology works for everyone, especially those most in need?
description: Historically, many people in the U.S. have not been able to use digital technology because it didn’t work for them — many federal websites were created with one type of user in mind, leaving several languages and lived experiences out of the building process. But given the rich diversity in this country, it is important that everyone is able to access the information they need.

10x has explored creating equitable digital experiences in a number of ways, including reducing bias in AI, co-designing digital products with American Indians and Alaska Natives, and finding effective ways to make government content available to people who aren’t proficient in English. But while a few projects are noted below, the value of equity has played a key role in all 10x projects and is central to all 10x investments.

### Check out some of our projects designed to create more equitable digital experiences:

Bringing mutual aid to underserved communities for post-disaster rebuilding
Underserved communities are uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We’re looking at ways to make it easier for public officials and volunteers to provide help to affected areas.

#### Combating bias in AI/ML

10x has developed tools to help public servants “de-bias” datasets that power AI. Developed in collaboration with the Census, the initial toolkit can help public servants use AI without the fear of introducing bias.

See the [Ableist Language Detector](https://10x.gsa.gov/reports/fy21-impact-report/)

#### Equity-centered design with American Indians and Alaska Natives

In the spirit of designing “with” and not “for,” 10x is developing a framework for federal agencies to better engage and collaborate with Tribal governments to create more meaningful and useful digital solutions.

#### Hearing resident perspectives on federal housing

Residents in federal housing do not have a way to communicate their values, candid perspectives, and needs to the government. 10x looked at whether there was a way to use technology to help them provide feedback on federal housing effectively and safely.

#### Improving access to translated content on government websites

For the more than 60 million Americans who are not fluent in English accessing information on government websites can be a challenge. Even when there is content in their language, it can be hard to find. 10x is conducting user testing with monolingual speakers of languages other than English to find out how to help them find content in their language.

#### Multilingual glossary tool

10x is investigating how to provide and manage a tool that will help public servants provide standardized translated terms to users with limited English proficiency (LEP). Using standardized terms that avoid jargon can make digital experiences easier for the American people and reduce duplicative translation efforts.

#### Resources for formerly incarcerated people

10x looked at how we can deliver a centralized resource to help people recently released from prison get the support they need to avoid reoffending by reentering society successfully.
