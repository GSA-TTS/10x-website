The U.S. Data Federation project promotes government-wide capacity-building to support distributed data management challenges, data interoperability, and broader data standards activities. Over the course of four phases, we created, curated, and documented reusable tools and repeatable processes and worked to make them available to practitioners across government. Specifically, we built and launched ReVal, a Reusable Validation Library, which has been used by the USDA Food & Nutrition Services and other agencies to streamline data collection and validation processes. We also supported Data.gov, OMB, and the Office of Government Information Services by developing a vision and delivering increased functionality for [resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov), an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other resources to support data governance, management, and use throughout the federal government.
