Federated data refers to data that are aggregated across a number of different sources. In government, these sources are often organizations, departments or agencies at various scales and levels, from federal down to local. Federated data efforts are increasingly seen as engines for transparency, economic growth, and accountability, but they present unique challenges compared to single-set data efforts. Despite the fact that federated data efforts are increasing in frequency, most  standard guidance and best practices  used by data practitioners in government pertain to the data _after_ it’s consolidated into one usable data set. Before this point, many practitioners are still improvising solutions in terms of standards definition, data collection, and data validation.

The Data Federation aims to address these challenges by focusing on supporting the critical early stages of federated data work. It seeks to research and develop reusable tools and approaches that streamline this stage of complex data work and accelerate a practitioners’ path toward having an analyzable data set from which to  generate meaningful findings.
