The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (21C) requires that any paper-based form related to serving the public be available in a digital format by December 2020. This project is expanding the treatment of digital forms in the US Web Design System (USWDS)  to support 21C, by adding more complex and sophisticated structures while supporting key USWDS principles, such as accessibility and mobile-friendliness. This work will empower agencies to deliver an exceptional user experience when interacting with the government.
