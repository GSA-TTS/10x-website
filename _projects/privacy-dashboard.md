We envision a future in which the public can easily understand how and why personally identifiable information gets collected by government agencies. To get there, we're working with federal privacy offices and structuring data from PDFed privacy-related compliance documents. By structuring data, we're equipping privacy offices with the ability to more quickly search through these documents, reducing unnecessary manual practices and laying a foundation for them to more easily collaborate with engineering teams.
