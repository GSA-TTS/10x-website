The PRA Guide is a plain language guide which answers the most common questions like, “What is the PRA for?”, “Do I need clearance?”, and “What’s the process?”

The PRA Guide  aims to give federal employees confidence in working with the PRA and lowering the barriers to working effectively with the public.
