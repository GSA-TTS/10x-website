Audit data for federal grants are trapped in PDFs and hidden within a dated and overly-complex search process. We created two tools, Distiller and the Audit Data Extractor, to quickly surface relevant audit data, reducing a multi-step—and potentially multi-day—process to minutes. Distiller makes it easy to access audit PDFs and relevant data through a streamlined intuitive interface that draws on data from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse and Beta.SAM.gov. The Audit Data Extractor Distiller reads Single Audit PDFs page by page with Natural Language Processing and extracts findings text and corrective action plans which can be viewed as a CSV.
