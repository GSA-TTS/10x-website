The 10x Federal Grantee Reporting project is building a prospective shared solution for the single audit finding resolution process. This is a high-priority element of post-award financial grant reporting.

The prototype dramatically streamlines the finding resolution process and gives agencies unprecedented visibility into single audit findings relevant to their shared grantees. This reduces costly and duplicative  efforts for agencies and grantees alike.

The prototype also provides easier access to data, reducing the  multi-day process to less than five minutes. This stands to help auditors, grant managers, agency CFOs and grantees.
