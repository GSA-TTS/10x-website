USA.gov and Gobierno.USA.gov provide a vital service: connecting members of the public with official information about government services. In an effort to better serve the public, both sites collect and act on feedback from users. Both sites collect feedback through various channels: call centers, chat feature, sitewide surveys, and page-level surveys. Our research is focused almost entirely on page-level surveys. Page-level surveys appear in nearly every content page, directory record page, and state details pages with content that answers users questions.
