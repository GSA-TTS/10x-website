Only 13% of government custom software projects succeed. To improve outcomes of IT projects and ensure federal dollars are well spent, we are piloting a new training series to state budgeting officials, legislative oversight committees and state agencies requesting federally-funded IT projects. Agile budgeting and oversight workshops are designed to provide a hands-on, operational version of the content within the agile budgeting and oversight handbook. Additionally, an iteration of this handbook is being developed to address topics specific to federal agencies.
