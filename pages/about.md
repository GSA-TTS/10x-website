<p class="usa-intro">
  An agile, innovative approach to solving problems for the public through technology
</p>

The 10x program is housed within General Service Administration’s (GSA) Technology Transformation Services (TTS) program. 10x takes an agile, innovative approach to technology that solves problems for the public. 

We ask federal employees like you to send us your idea – in just two or three sentences – on ways government digital experiences can be better, or easier, or more accessible for the public.

##  You’ve observed a problem that tech can solve – send us your idea on how to fix it

We're looking for ideas that take all shapes and sizes. Since our launch in 2015, we've found that the people closest to the problem are the ones best equipped to come up with innovative ways to solve them. 10x helps you do that. 

<aside class="pull-quote">
  Working with 10x was easy and a good experience. The culture is friendly, open, collaborative, and innovative, and the team gave me a chance to participate.

</aside>

But the idea you send in doesn't have to solve a problem in your agency or be directly connected to your agency’s mission. Maybe you're a veteran, and you have lived experience that sparked an idea on making it easier to figure out government benefits and services. 

Our idea intake is open exclusively to federal employees. So if you're a federal worker with an idea to improve government digital services, we want you to share your idea! Read more about [What we do]({{ what-we-do-url | url}}).
