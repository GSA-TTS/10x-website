Welcome to 10x Impact! This is the place to learn about how 10x is using our investment dollars to deliver impact for the American public. Here you’ll find the annual impact reports we’ve released since FY2017. You’ll notice that the first web-friendly impact report is for FY22. We see this change from PDFs to an HTML format as a great metaphor for how we’ve grown as a program.{.TxLede}

Whether you’re a policymaker, a member of the press, or even a curious member of the public–we want to demonstrate how our investments do right by you. This is our shot at proving the value of our program and the incredible impact that government innovation can deliver to improve lives. Enjoy!{.TxLede}
