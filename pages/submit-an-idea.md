  Now's your chance to share that problem or idea and see if it's the next big thing to improve how we serve the public.

###  What's the problem? 

Clearly state the problem or opportunity, and keep it simpleâ€“under 1,000 characters! We're looking to solve real problems with big impact.

#### Follow this simple structure:

> **I've observed [problem or opportunity] and believe that if we [do this] it'll result in [this benefit] for [this group of people].**

### Who benefits from solving this problem?

If we can solve a problem, who benefits from the solution? Is it government employees? Medicare recipients? Citizen scientists? Researchers? 

### How will the solution help?

Does the potential solution make something easier, faster, more accurate? More inclusive and equitable? A measurably better customer experience? Help us understand why it matters.
