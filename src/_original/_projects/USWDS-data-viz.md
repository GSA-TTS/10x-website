Data visualizations are an important way for the government to communicate data to the public; however, poorly-designed visualizations can be difficult to interpret and use correctly.  Over the course of two phases, we investigated the creation of guidance and principles within the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) for publishers of government data visualizations to improve accessibility and usability while remaining tool-agnostic. By focusing on simplicity, clarity, and lossless representation, data visualizations that appear in government reports, web pages, and other media can be more accessible, usable, and inclusive.
