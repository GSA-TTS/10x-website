USA.gov and Gobierno.USA.gov provide a vital service: connecting members of the public with official information about government services. In an effort to better serve the public, both sites collect and act on feedback from users through a number of challenges, including page-level surveys. Page-level surveys appear in nearly every content page, directory record page, and state details pages with content that answers users questions. We built a tool that uses this data to build natural language processing and machine learning models to allow iterative automated data exploration and provide insights, which can be used to identify issues, opportunities and make decisions to improve the user experience with this critical public-facing resource.
