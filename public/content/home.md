<Grid className="font-sans-md line-height-sans-3 margin-y-8">We are in the process of evaluating submissions for FY20 Round 2 funding. Thank you to everyone who submitted ideas to 10x. For those who submitted ideas by August 5: we will let you know whether your idea was or was not selected for this round by late August. Thank you for taking the time and effort to support government innovation! Our submission form is still open, but all new idea submissions (beginning August 6) will be evaluated as part of our next round of idea evaluations, currently slated for Winter 2021.

## First, send 10x your idea.

It’s easy to submit an idea to 10x and we want to hear yours. Simply send 10x your idea via our Submission form. We accept ideas on a rolling basis from U.S. federal employees and evaluate them twice a year. Submit your idea before August 5, 2020 to be considered for our next round of evaluations.

### 10x is looking for ideas that:

- Have an impact across the federal government or on the public.
- Enhance the public’s experience with government through technology.
- Improve how government builds and shares technology to better serve the public.
- Are part of a big or rapidly growing market in government technology.

### How should you present your idea? Your idea should:

- Be no more than 1000 characters in length.
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem you want to solve.
- Focus on creating a new product or service that is good for government.
- Be as clear and descriptive as possible.

As we scale this program it’s important that 10x hears ideas that impact all aspects of the federal government. Your idea is valuable. If you need help putting together an idea or have questions about what we’re looking for, email us at 10x@gsa.gov. We’re happy to connect you with a technology expert or someone to review what you have and make sure your idea is clear.

## Then, 10x goes to work.

> 10x evaluates ideas and funds those with the most promise.

A few times a year, 10x collects all the ideas and evaluates them for funding. The most promising ideas proceed to Phase 1.

Your idea will be evaluated based on the following 3 criteria, each given equal weight:

<ul>
<li><span><strong>Clarity.</strong> Does the idea demonstrate an understanding of a real problem and communicate it clearly?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Alignment.</strong> Does the idea help develop new, good-for-government technology?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Impact.</strong> Does solving this problem have an important effect on the federal government or the public?</span></li>
</ul>

If selected, 10x starts its funding small — only magnifying its investment <Link to="/the-10x-process">as an idea develops, step-by-step, into a sustainable project</Link>. This iterative approach, based on modern technology and investment practices, ensures that the best ideas turn into the best government products and services — funded with fewer taxpayer dollars.

10x projects are managed and staffed by project teams within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) department of the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/).
