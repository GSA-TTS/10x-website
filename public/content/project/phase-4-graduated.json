  "excerpt": "Data collected and produced across the federal government come in many forms, and for it to be most useful in informing services and policy it needs to be aggregated, which is often time consuming and difficult. The team developed an approach to create repeatable processes and tools to make it easier to collect, combine, and exchange data from disparate sources.",
  "body": "## Overview\n\nData informs all kinds of decision making in the federal government, but the wide array of sources and structures and units make sharing data — an activity that could result in better, more complete analysis — come down somewhere between horribly difficult and impossible. By creating tools and processes to make it easier, the Team was able to help make decision-making founded on data better. And they did this through extensive research with users and stakeholders to define what was needed and how it needs to be available. \n\n## At a glance\n\n1. **Federated data resources**\n1. **Intended Audience:** Government efficiencies, Program administrators\n1. **Phase:** Phase 4 - Graduated\n1. **Idea Submitted:** 20XX\n1. **Contact:** XX\n\n### Our goal\n\nIncrease government transparency, promote data-driven decision making, and help the government build faster and smarter by developing reusable tooling and processes to enable federated data efforts.\n\n#### How we did it\n\nDeep research and stakeholder input informed the development of resources.data.gov, an open repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use throughout the federal government. \n\n#### Where we are today\n\nResources.data.gov is available and maintained by Federal Enterprise Data Resources. The tools and resources are currently in use at many agencies, including XXX.\n\n<Card color=\"accent-warm-light\">\n\n#### Why this matters\n\nFederated data efforts are increasingly seen as an engine for transparency, economic growth, and accountability, yet collecting that data remains a challenge. Despite the fact that efforts of this sort are increasing in frequency, each new effort is still improvising solutions in terms of processes, tooling, and compliance infrastructure. It's time to take this problem seriously and invest in reusable tools and approaches that will streamline federated data efforts in the years to come. In short,\n\n- Getting good, reliable data is hard\n- Data from different sources makes this even harder\n- Data providers are less likely to contribute to system that are difficult and time consuming to useList\n\n</Card>\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe’d recommend continuing to extend resources.data.gov to include:\n\n- Working with agency partners to surface resources, from agency-specific examples to generalized, plug-and-play components\n- Provide the infrastructure for sharing resources across the government with clear contribution and publication guidelines and support\n- Support the work of communities of practice, the Federal Data Strategy, the CDO Council, and individual managers and practitioners across the government\n- \n",
