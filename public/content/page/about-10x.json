We fund internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.\n\nWe focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov), and the [TTS Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/tts).\n\nOur funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x is a program that lives within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and is managed by the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs).\n\n## Calls for ideas\n\nWe are in the process of evaluating submissions for FY20 Round 2 funding. Thank you to everyone who submitted ideas to 10x. For those who submitted ideas by August 5: we will let you know whether your idea was or was not selected for this round by late August. Thank you for taking the time and effort to support government innovation! Our submission form is still open, but all new idea submissions (beginning August 6) will be evaluated as part of our next round of idea evaluations, currently slated for Winter 2021.\n\n<Button url=\"/\" color=\"accent-warm\">Pitch an idea<br /><span>\nusing our Submission form</span></Button>\n\n## 10x privacy policy\n\n### Information you send us as a pitch\n\nFederal employees can voluntarily send us information as part of an idea submission for 10x funding by sending an email message to 10x@gsa.gov or by submitting a project idea through our online form. Your idea will be shared with subject-matter experts and the 10x Program Advisory Board in order to make funding decisions. We publish information about which ideas do and do not receive funding, along with the date of submission, your name, and the name of your agency or organization. If your idea is accepted for funding, your name and home agency will be listed on our website. In some cases, we might feature your actual idea on our website for teaching and promotion purposes.\n\nWe cannot accept ideas from the general public. If you are **not** a federal employee and you submit an idea for funding, we’ll only use your information to reply to your message. We will not keep the information you sent as part of your idea.\n\n### Everything else\n\nFor everything else, we follow the practices outlined in GSA’s [privacy and security notice](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/privacy-and-security-notice).\n\n</Grid>\n\n<LocationMenu />",
