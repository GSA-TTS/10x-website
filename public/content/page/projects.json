Our project teams evaluate each idea as it moves through different phases, selecting only a few to promote to the next phase where it gets closer to a launchable product. If a project graduates, it means it’s ready for prime time and can start gaining traction within government agencies. \n\n## Projects\n\nWe often have more than 250 projects in varying phases of development—here are some of the innovative current and past projects in our program.  \n\n<ProjectList />\n\n</Grid>\n\n<LocationMenu />",
