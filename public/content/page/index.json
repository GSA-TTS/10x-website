Agencies often cite frustration with accessing and understanding OMB’s policies on the PRA, which are spread across numerous inaccessible PDFs. This situation has reduced compliance and created delays in the approval of information collection requests (ICRs). Through outreach to PRA desk officers and agency staff, and in consultation with OIRA, TTS will explore what it would take to modernize the way agencies interact with OMB’s policies in order to design an accessible, user-friendly online interface to respond to agency inquiries.”\n\n</Card>\n\n<Button url=\"/\" color=\"accent-warm\">Pitch an idea<br />\n<span>using our Submission form</span></Button>\n\n</Grid>\n\n<LocationMenu />\n","hero":"<Grid>\n\n# Send us an idea\n\n> 10x wants ideas from federal employees that improve the public’s experience with government through technology.\n\n<ColorBox outer=\"accent-cool\" middle=\"accent-warm-lighter\" inner=\"accent-warm\" />\n\n</Grid>","type":"page","name":"send-us-an-idea","path":"/send-us-an-idea","excerpt":"<Button url=\"/\" color=\"accent-warm\">","toc":[{"text":"Eligibility","url":"#eligibility"},{"text":"What makes a good idea?","url":"#what-makes-a-good-idea"},{"text":"Need some help?","url":"#need-some-help"},{"text":"Examples of ideas 10x has funded","url":"#examples-of-ideas-10x-has-funded"}]},{"title":"The 10x Process","body":"<Grid className=\"padding-bottom-6 tablet:padding-bottom-10\">\n\n## [](#overview)[](#overview)[](#overview)Overview\n\n-   First, 10x collects a broad range of ideas. \n-   Next, we select ideas based on their potential impact and scalability.\n-   Finally, 10x funds each selected idea in phases, as the project matures.\n\n## [](#diverse-ideas-from-civil-servants)[](#diverse-ideas-from-civil-servants)[](#diverse-ideas-from-civil-servants)Diverse ideas from civil servants\n\n10x believes that federal civil servants — with their front row view to the inner workings of our government — are uniquely positioned to identify the key problems that impede our government from achieving its mission. 10x aims to uncover and elevate the most promising ideas from the federal workforce.\n\nTo do this, we explore a lot of ideas at once with a small initial investment in each. The goal is to identify the immediate opportunities as well as the risks that an idea might present without spending too much money too quickly. This approach enables us to identify – within a few weeks – ideas and approaches that are most likely to have an impact.\n\nEach subsequent phase of funding allows for a greater investment into an idea and requires project teams to continue to prove potential impact and demonstrate that a project can succeed. Between phases, we review progress to determine if we should continue investing in a project and many projects do not proceed beyond Phase 1. This way, only the best ideas receive large investments and we avoid spending millions of taxpayer dollars on ideas that won’t work.\n\n## [](#how-10x-selects-projects)[](#how-10x-selects-projects)[](#how-10x-selects-projects)How 10x selects projects\n\n10x accepts ideas from federal employees throughout the year.

We start by gathering ideas from federal civil servants. These proposals are intentionally short — only about 2–3 sentences (no more than 1000 characters) — to stay focused on a specific, concrete problem. If your idea is selected, 10x will notify you and will hire a small team for Phase 1 to further evaluate the idea.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card color=\"accent-cool-light\" title=\"Phase 1: Investigation\">\n\nThink it through. Accepted ideas spend 2-3 weeks exploring the idea to define what it would take to be successful — uncovering risks, roadblocks, and opportunities. At this point, people who submit ideas can act as subject matter experts for a research and strategy team dedicated to quickly evaluating the idea. Only the most promising ideas will proceed into Phase 2.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card color=\"accent-cool\" title=\"Phase 2: Discovery\">\n\nGo deep. Gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, and how to scale. Analyze what could go right and wrong, and create an initial strategy to address these issues. For this and later phases, you are welcome to work alongside the team that is developing this idea.\n\n</Card>\n\n<Card color=\"accent-cool-darker\" title=\"Phase 3: Development\">\n\nBuild it out and plan for the future. Develop a functional minimum viable product with at least one active customer. Create a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy. Provide a data-backed market analysis.

Your role will be that of a subject matter expert and you can be involved in the process as much or as little as you are able.
