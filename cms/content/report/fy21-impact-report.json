  "impact": "## Why this matters\n\nThe PRA has been a source of frustration for many government employees for years. It was passed during a time before the internet existed and was not designed to govern interactions between the government and the public during the digital age. Because the law restricts the amount and types of information that the government is allowed to request from the public, some federal employees shy away from conducting user research with the public at all because they are afraid of running afoul of the law or are intimidated by the process it takes to receive PRA clearance. Because of this report, government researchers can more confidently navigate the PRA process and are more empowered to interact with the public in critical ways — like for user research for improved web content — and the initial intent of the law is clear and easy to understand.",
  "approach": "## What we did\n\nWe built a website that serves as the go-to place for the thousands of federal employees seeking PRA clearance to learn about the PRA, how it may or may not affect their work, and how to successfully navigate the process of getting clearance to interact with the public.\n\n### How we did it\n\nWe interviewed dozens of PRA officers and staffers from OMB who interpret the PRA to learn about common misperceptions of the law and we spoke with federal employees who have navigated the compliance process. We focused on a key audience with specific needs  —  smaller agencies without dedicated internal PRA support—and conducted research with them to understand their needs. Then, we partnered with legal experts who have deep knowledge of the law to interpret the necessary components and guidance into user-friendly digital content. Finally,  we built a website to host this guidance.\n\n### Where we are today\n\n[PRA.digital.gov](https://pra.digital.gov/) lives as a partnership between GSA and OMB. GSA maintains the digital infrastructure; OMB maintains and updates the content.",
  "welcome": "## Welcome to the 10x FY21 Impact Report!\n\nIt’s been an eventful year for the country, the world, and the small but mighty team behind the 10x program. We experienced the darkest days of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a change in administrations, the sudden loss of a beloved colleague, and shifting budgetary priorities which affected 10x’s bottom line. Despite all of these changes and challenges, we never lost our focus: to invest in and experiment with technology ideas from federal employees that are equally exciting and unproven, with the potential to radically improve how the government delivers for the public.\n\nIn last year’s Impact Report, we highlighted an exciting trend we had noticed across our portfolio: our projects were transitioning from delivering mere prototypes to shipping live products. Whether it was dashboards, forms components, benefits screeners, or API’s, we watched with pride as our products got real notice from around the government and solved problems. For this year’s report, the trend we want to highlight is that we’ve stepped decidedly into new frontiers of technology and dabbled in market creation. Over the last year, 10x projects have conducted experiments and researched some of the cutting edge technologies that are shaping the private sector and will surely impact government service in the future. 10x is proud to be one of the few civilian agencies that is keeping track of dynamic, emerging technologies and preparing the government for how to approach, adopt, and leverage these technologies for the public good.\n\nOver the last year, we’ve met more inspiring folks fighting the good fight and making innovation happen in, and for, government than ever before. We want to thank our cheerleaders and fellow innovators working behind the scenes to create breathing room for programs like 10x to exist. And lastly, a heartfelt thank you to the record-number of federal employees who raised a hand and submitted an idea to 10x over the last year. 10x can’t make an impact without you.\n\nSincerely,",
  "future": "## Next steps\n\nThe website we built is designed to be continually updated as the needs arise, reflecting  modifications to the law or extensions for the law to serve new audiences. The site as it exists today is the perfect foundation for expansion.  With further enhancements, the government can demystify the PRA process for many thousands more government employees who want to both serve the public and stay in compliance with the law.",

      "content": "10x has funded hundreds of projects over the years and we always encourage our teams to practice good agile hygiene, of which the retrospective, or ‘retro’ is a critical part. That’s when a team pauses after a development sprint (usually every two weeks) to look back and examine what did and didn’t go well over the previous fortnight and how to improve things moving forward. In the spirit of practicing what we preach, 10x has taken a retrospective look at over the last year. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n### What we learned\n\nLast year, we decided it was time to act on one of the lessons we learned from talking with venture capital firms in the private sector over the years: the importance of portfolio development. For most of 10x’s history, we’ve practiced what we call the ‘everything bagel’ approach to sourcing the types of ideas we wanted to invest in. We left the market wide-open and accepted ideas across every topic in government technology you can think of: contracting, cybersecurity, robotic process automation, etc.\n\nIn FY21, we did something different. We shifted away from the everything-bagel-approach and created parameters for the types of projects we wanted to target by creating investment themes. Overall, our first shot at developing investment themes and catering our project intake process around them was a big success, and they worked in our favor for many reasons.  \n\nFirst, having defined themes has made outreach easier. For example, when we decided that Public Lands and the Environment would be a theme, we immediately knew where to go looking for great ideas: federal agencies that work to protect and study the environment.\n\n\n\nSecond, having defined themes enabled us to develop important contacts and map the who’s who of certain problem spaces. One of the challenges on new 10x projects is figuring out where to start and who to talk with first. By identifying themes and creating a portfolio structure, we’re able to create a rolodex of contacts and subject-matter expertise that we can easily tap into when starting a new project, or when making connections between existing projects.\n\n\n\nLastly, having themes just made it easier to compare different ideas during our evaluation periods. For example, it’s easier to debate the merits and opportunities of two ideas that take different angles on climate challenges than it is to compare the merits of a cybersecurity idea with an acquisitions idea.\n\n\n\n### Where we struggled\n\n\n\nAt 10x, we are extremely fortunate to have a high degree of flexibility in the types of work we take on and our unique, iterative investment approach is good at spotting risks, demonstrating the value of projects, and ending them when it’s time to stop. Having said that, we are not immune to the realities of life inside a bureaucracy, and the currents that affect project outcomes outside of the inherent unknowns in agile work affect us, too. Basically, we are still a government program and things happen outside our control that aren’t always to our benefit. We own failure, learn, move on, and try to make the most of what we build by repurposing technology, made easier by always working in the open. \n\nA common occurrence in government is that sudden changes in priorities and personnel can quickly derail long-term, high-dollar projects, which is a frustration experienced by civil servants all the time. 10x is not immune to any of this and it can and does happen to our projects. In addition to disrupting long-term projects, changes in priorities and personnel typically also lead to changes in budgetary allocations--another source of disruption in federal agencies. Over the past year, some of our funding was repurposed and that limited the number of projects we were able to fund.\n\nBut, we’re trained to make the most of what we have. Limiting the number of projects we can invest in forces us to think more critically about funding decisions and really consider the question:  is this project really worth moving forward? \n\n### Where we shined\n\nOne of the highest confidence-boosts that government program folks can feel is when their work happens to align perfectly with Administration-level priorities. It is validating to know that your work is directly contributing to an overall vision for public service. One area where we really excelled over the last year has been finding areas of significant overlap between what our projects are doing and what the new Administration wants to do. Whether it's the CASES Act, 21st Century IDEA, or the executive order on racial justice, our 10x projects have something to offer.\n\nAnother positive development over the last year has been the advancement of projects that are building products for use directly by members of the public. We’ve had many projects that build back-end software or issue guidance to feds of one type or another. But over the last year we’ve been focusing more on public-facing work. Just like alignment with higher government priorities, making things that will be used by real people is a boon to our confidence that 10x is on the right track. A good example of this work is our Benefits Eligibility Awareness Recognition Service (BEARS) project, which is developing a digital capability for folks to find and apply for benefits offered by many different agencies.\n\nThe last area of significant pride we want to highlight is that we’re now dabbling in new technologies in a way we haven’t before. APIs, data products, playbooks, and websites have been our bread and butter for years. No longer. Keep reading to see how we’re engaging with emerging technologies in privacy engineering and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n"

      "content": "### Project Funding\n\nThe 10x budget is funded through the Digital Services Fund (DSF). This allocation is reserved for new, good for government products and services and empowers 10x to support low-cost exploratory investigations to identify and prototype promising technology. 10x works with a “no-year” budget, which means our total annual investment budget is the combination of funding appropriated for that fiscal year, plus any unspent funds carried over from the previous fiscal year. This allows 10x-backed projects to cross over fiscal years without any disruption, a key factor in our projects’ success. As the stewards of the DSF, we prioritize having accurate, detailed documentation on how every dollar has been spent since the fund’s creation in FY15.\n\nWe had our work cut out for us during FY21. At the beginning of the year, the DSF was reduced by 40%, which meant 10x had $2.624 million fewer dollars than expected based on our usual annual appropriations. Thankfully,  our nimble operating model helped us adjust quickly to these new circumstances. We adapted by trimming down the total number of projects we invested in. For example, we only funded about 20 Phase One projects, instead of the 40 we funded last year. We also held only one round of idea evaluation and funding, instead of our usual two. And lastly, we decided to eliminate funding for Phase Four projects and committed instead to exploring numerous other funding avenues to help our projects scale.\n\n",

Without guidance and proper tooling, every agency will be left to navigate these challenges alone and may either fall into non-compliance or look for expensive private sector solutions.\n\nSolution: USWDS is well positioned to provide guidance and resources to agencies navigating the process of digitizing their forms. Over the course of this project, 10x built nine new form components, including button groups, character counts, date pickers, and other features. These components have been incorporated into the USWDS, which is already helping agencies as they begin digitizing their paper-based forms all while promoting key USWDS principles, such as accessibility and mobile-friendliness.\n\nImpact: The form components built by the team are invaluable resources to web managers and other technologists across the government who need to comply with legislative mandates. The presence of these form components also further entrenches the USWDS as the center of gravity for design best practices within government. This new form functionality expanded the potential user base for the USWDS and accelerated adoption. Most recently, GSA’s Acquisition Gateway adopted the system and is using the new form components we delivered. The program has further seen adoption or expressions of interest from numerous others across the federal government. This work helps agencies deliver elegant user experiences for the public, which is the bread and butter of the 10x mission."
