  "impact": "## Why this matters\n\nThe PRA has been a source of frustration for many government employees for years. It was passed during a time before the internet existed and was not designed to govern interactions between the government and the public during the digital age. Because the law restricts the amount and types of information that the government is allowed to request from the public, some federal employees shy away from conducting user research with the public at all because they are afraid of running afoul of the law or are intimidated by the process it takes to receive PRA clearance. Because of this report, government researchers can more confidently navigate the PRA process and are more empowered to interact with the public in critical ways — like for user research for improved web content — and the initial intent of the law is clear and easy to understand.",
  "approach": "## What we did\n\nWe built a website that serves as the go-to place for the thousands of federal employees seeking PRA clearance to learn about the PRA, how it may or may not affect their work, and how to successfully navigate the process of getting clearance to interact with the public.\n\n### How we did it\n\nWe interviewed dozens of PRA officers and staffers from OMB who interpret the PRA to learn about common misperceptions of the law and we spoke with federal employees who have navigated the compliance process. We focused on a key audience with specific needs  —  smaller agencies without dedicated internal PRA support—and conducted research with them to understand their needs. Then, we partnered with legal experts who have deep knowledge of the law to interpret the necessary components and guidance into user-friendly digital content. Finally,  we built a website to host this guidance.\n\n### Where we are today\n\n[PRA.digital.gov](https://pra.digital.gov/) lives as a partnership between GSA and OMB. GSA maintains the digital infrastructure; OMB maintains and updates the content.",
  "welcome": "## Welcome to the 10x FY21 Impact Report!\n\nIt’s been an eventful year for the country, the world, and the small but mighty team behind the 10x program. We experienced the darkest days of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a change in administrations, the sudden loss of a beloved colleague, and shifting budgetary priorities which affected 10x’s bottom line. Despite all of these changes and challenges, we never lost our focus: to invest in and experiment with technology ideas from federal employees that are equally exciting and unproven, with the potential to radically improve how the government delivers for the public.\n\nIn last year’s Impact Report, we highlighted an exciting trend we had noticed across our portfolio: our projects were transitioning from delivering mere prototypes to shipping live products. Whether it was dashboards, forms components, benefits screeners, or API’s, we watched with pride as our products got real notice from around the government and solved problems. For this year’s report, the trend we want to highlight is that we’ve stepped decidedly into new frontiers of technology and dabbled in market creation. Over the last year, 10x projects have conducted experiments and researched some of the cutting edge technologies that are shaping the private sector and will surely impact government service in the future. 10x is proud to be one of the few civilian agencies that is keeping track of dynamic, emerging technologies and preparing the government for how to approach, adopt, and leverage these technologies for the public good.\n\nOver the last year, we’ve met more inspiring folks fighting the good fight and making innovation happen in, and for, government than ever before. We want to thank our cheerleaders and fellow innovators working behind the scenes to create breathing room for programs like 10x to exist. And lastly, a heartfelt thank you to the record-number of federal employees who raised a hand and submitted an idea to 10x over the last year. 10x can’t make an impact without you.\n\nSincerely,",
  "future": "## Next steps\n\nThe website we built is designed to be continually updated as the needs arise, reflecting  modifications to the law or extensions for the law to serve new audiences. The site as it exists today is the perfect foundation for expansion.  With further enhancements, the government can demystify the PRA process for many thousands more government employees who want to both serve the public and stay in compliance with the law.",

      "content": "**Welcome to the 10x Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) Impact Report!**\n\n2021 has been an eventful year for the world, the country, and our small but mighty 10x team. The uncertainty around the pandemic, transitioning to a new administration, and shifting budget priorities affected our bottom line. Despite all this, we never lost our focus and we continued to do our job: invest in and experiment on federal employees’ technology ideas and see if they work.  As always, we want to radically improve how the government uses technology innovation to serve the public.\n\nEach fiscal year, we try to identify new trends across our projects that can help us understand our own growth and maturity as a program. Last year, we saw an exciting trend: across our portfolio, our projects were moving from delivering prototypes to shipping live, active products. These products were dashboards, new forms components, benefits screeners, and APIs. They solved real problems. The impact was recognized by our peers and the market.\n\nThis year, we identified a new pattern:  we’ve become fully immersed in new frontiers of technology exploration. We’re not just experimenting with technologies that are relatively unknown to the government, but we’re actively developing these dynamic new technologies. We’re preparing the government to approach, adopt, and use these technologies for public good.\n\nWe’ve met inspiring people fighting the good innovation fight and making things happen in— and for—government more than ever before. Thank you to our supporters and fellow innovators who create space for programs like 10x to exist. And, special thank you to the record number of federal employees who submitted ideas to 10x over the last year. We can’t make an impact without you.\n\nSincerely,",

      "content": "We’ve funded hundreds of projects over the years. We always encourage our teams to practice good agile hygiene. The retrospective (retro) is critical. We pause after a development sprint to look back and examine what did and didn’t go well. We explore how to improve things\n\nPracticing what we preach, we've conducted a retro to examine the last year. Here are our main takeaways:\n\n",
      "contentHalf": "### Where we succeeded\n\nFor most of our history, we’ve used what we call the “everything bagel approach” to source the types of ideas we want to invest in. This approach meant we left the market wide open and accepted ideas across every topic in government technology you can think of, including contracting, cybersecurity, robotic process automation (RPA), etc.\n\n",
      "calloutHalf": "At 10x, we are extremely fortunate to have a high degree of flexibility in the types of work we take on and our unique, iterative investment",
      "content2": "In FY21, we did something different. We moved away from the “everything bagel approach” and  defined a few specific areas of the government technology ecosystem where we were particularly interested in exploring. We called these areas investment themes. Defining the types of projects where we wanted to invest allowed us to set up parameters for the ideas we wanted to target and center our outreach accordingly. The first themes we chose were Public Trust and Civic Life, Equity in Delivery, and Public Lands and the Environment.\n\nWhy these themes? In order to serve the public, we need to understand what matters to the public. And one of the great privileges of being in the civil service is that we are able to bring our whole selves to our work: both as civil servants and as members of the public. After all, we live in communities, we talk with friends and neighbors, and we read the news just like everyone else. In other words, we get to wear two hats at once. We hear what people discuss and what matters to them, and we feel that our themes address topics (like low trust in government and concerns about our changing natural environment) that the public will recognize as timely and directly relevant to their lives.\n\nThat change succeeded and worked in our favor for a few reasons: First, defining themes made outreach easier. For example, when we made Public Lands and the Environment a theme, we immediately knew where to look for great ideas: federal agencies that work to protect and study the environment.\n\nSecond, defining themes allowed us to develop important contacts and map the who’s who of certain problem spaces in government technology. One of our challenges on new 10x projects is figuring out where to start and who to talk with first. By moving towards this structure, we’ve built strong contacts with subject-matter experts who we can easily consult on projects relevant to their expertise.\n\nThird, having themes made it easier to compare different ideas during our evaluation periods. For example, it’s easier to debate the merits and opportunities of two ideas that take different angles on climate challenges than it is to compare the merits of a cybersecurity idea to an acquisitions idea.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, having defined themes allowed us to align our program’s investment portfolio with topics that matter to the public.\n\n### Where we struggled\n\nAt 10x, we’re lucky to be flexible in what projects we take on. Our uniquely iterative investment approach spots risks, shows projects’ value, and ends them when it’s time to stop.\n\nHowever, we are not immune to bureaucratic realities. We are still a government program; things happen outside our control that don’t always work to our benefit. We learn and adapt.\n\nOften in government, sudden changes in priorities and personnel can suddenly derail long-term, high-dollar projects. We’re not immune to this experience. It can and does happen to our projects. As well as disrupting long-term projects, changes in priorities and personnel typically also change our budgetary allocations. As a result, we scaled back the number of planned projects for the year.\n\nBut we’re trained to make the most of what we have. With a more limited number of projects we can invest in, it forces us to think more critically about funding decisions. We had to really ask ourselves: is this project really worth the investment dollars we have available?\n\n",
      "calloutFull": "At 10x, we are extremely fortunate to have a high degree of flexibility in the types of work we take on and our unique, iterative investment",
      "content3": "### Where we shined\n\nFor government program managers, one of the best confidence boosters is when our work happens to align well with administration-level priorities.\n\nOne area where we really excelled last year was finding areas of significant overlap between what our projects are doing and what the new Administration wants to do. Many of our FY21 projects directly supported legislation and/or government-wide priorities, such as\n\n- [CASES Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1079),\n- [21st Century IDEA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text), and\n- [the Executive Order on racial justice](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).\n\nAnother success was advancing projects that build products that the public can use. In the past, many projects delivered back-end software for agencies or guidance for federal employees.\n\nBut this past year, as a program within GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS), we’ve been focusing more on public-facing work that help drive. TTS’ vision to create trusted modern government experiences for all. If we’re delivering products that support legislation and other priorities—while building things that the public will use directly—means we’re on the right track.\n\nOne example of this work is our [Benefits Eligibility Awareness Recognition Service (BEARS)](https://demo.10.gsa.gov/projects/benefits-eligibility-resource/) project. It helps folks to find and apply for benefits that different agencies offer.\n\nWe’ve been working with new technologies in ways we haven’t before. For years, APIs, data products, playbooks, and websites were our bread and butter.\n\nNo longer. Keep reading to see how we’re engaging with emerging technologies, like privacy engineering and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n"

This allows 10x-backed projects to cross over fiscal years without any disruption, a key factor in our projects’ success. As the stewards of the DSF, we prioritize having accurate, detailed documentation on how every dollar has been spent since the fund’s creation in FY15.\n\nIn FY21, we had our work cut out for us. At the beginning of the year, the DSF was reduced by 40%, which meant 10x had $2.624 million fewer dollars than expected based on our usual annual appropriations.  To meet these challenges, we trimmed down the total number of projects we invested in. For example, we only funded about 20 Phase One projects, instead of the 40 we funded the year prior. We also held only one round of idea evaluation and funding, instead of our usual two. And lastly, we made the difficult choice to eliminate funding for Phase Four projects and committed instead to exploring numerous other funding avenues to help our projects scale beyond Phase Three.\n\n",

To check out some of our other work, please head over to the [projects section of our site](https://10x.gsa.gov/projects/). It’s got the scoop on what we learned and the impact we’ve created through our individual projects._\n\n",
      "content2": "**How a 10x investment enshrines democratic principles in a changing govtech landscape**\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies will affect how the government serves the public. [Public sector spending on AI is projected to reach well into the billions before long](https://www.federaltimes.com/thought-leadership/2021/09/28/why-the-government-market-for-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-expanding/). Federal CIOs have encouraged agencies to start experimenting with AI and two previous presidential administrations have all issued guidance, memoranda, or executive orders specific to AI adoption in government.\n\nDespite all of this momentum, AI/ML technologies are fairly new to many government agencies. Many are still figuring out how these exciting new capabilities can support their business needs and how they can start adopting them.\n\nWe’ve funded several AI-related projects over the years and made some observations. We believe that AI/ML use in government is going to accelerate and it’s going to come with challenges. The stakes are high and the government needs to get it right the first time.\n\nStakes are high because AI/ML implementations risk harm if not done thoughtfully and ethically. These technologies help make real decisions that affect people’s lives, so fairness is a paramount concern. Enshrining democratic values like fairness, equity, and equality in AI/ML is a tall order. So where do we begin? How can we deliver impact here?\n\n### Bias Toolkit\n\nTo meet this challenge, we placed a bet on the table: combating bias in upstream datasets—before they go through an AI pipeline that can make important decisions—is a good place to start.\n\nThroughout FY21, the 10x team worked with the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) to develop the bias toolkit. This project along with our other AI-related projects, is how we’re helping the government get AI/ML right during these early days.\n\n **What we delivered**\n\nThe toolkit includes three functioning de-biasing tools that federal employees can use to lay a more equitable foundation for their AI-enhanced workflows. Together, these three tools provide a great foundation for future de-biasing initiatives.\n\n- The first tool creates carbon copies of datasets with placeholder (or ‘dummy’ data) that allows a federal employee to generate and test multiple, similar datasets through the AI model algorithm. Testing AI models with both real and placeholder data helps reveal sources of bias that might remain hidden if the model were trained only on the target dataset.\n\n- The second tool uses AI to detect ableist language in federal job postings, which is language that may be offensive to people with disabilities. The tool automatically suggests more appropriate, inclusive alternatives that hiring managers can use to create better, more equitable job descriptions.\n\n",
      "image": "projectDemo",
      "content3": "- The third tool offers a standard language format, or model card, that describes the AI/ML model’s characteristics. Similar to a nutrition label on a can of soup that tells you the ingredients, nutritional profile, and allergen warnings, the model card shows the characteristics—including errors that could lead to biased outputs if left unaddressed–within that AI model. Model cards provide transparency about the AI model’s limitations and can help people re-use these models equitably and transparently.\n\nThe toolkit is currently in beta and awaiting a full launch in FY22. Census will own, maintain, and expand the toolkit. As the U.S. government’s premier statistical agency, Census works with the types of eye-poppingly large, complex datasets that power advanced AI, making them a great fit for championing this work into the future.\n\n**Why we’re proud of this**\n\nEveryone wins when a project is moved to where it can continue to thrive after exiting the 10x funding pipeline. An example of  how two agencies should work together, it’s a great project transition that will have a huge impact.\n\nWe showcase this de-biasing project because we believe it resonates with communities outside of our core user base of federal employees. This project lives at the intersection of two of the most important conversations that we, as a country, are having and highlights how the government is responding. The first conversation focuses on reckoning with injustice in our society as experienced by minority and vulnerable populations. The second is the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence and the cultural angst around how AI and other emerging technologies will affect society (for better or worse) in the years to come.\n\nWe’re proud of this project and we’re proud that we helped ensure that the government adopts rapidly advancing, powerful technologies in a way that shows a serious effort to protect democratic values and delivers positive, meaningful impact for the public. We are excited to see it grow and mature under the stewardship of our U.S. Census Bureau partners. Be on the lookout for the full roll-out in 2022, we’ll keep our site updated. In the meantime, the initial toolkit is open-source and available freely on the web. Anyone in the world can find, use, and contribute to our tools.\n\n**Summary**\n\n10x is a small program within our own agency and we are only one of many initiatives across the government that are also thinking about the future of AI/ML in public service delivery. Naturally, the private sector and other groups will play a central role in the future of public sector AI/ML adoption. But we believe the government has a special role to play.\n\nOur ambition for this project was to make small, positive interventions that reinforced democratic values of justice and equity as the government adopts AI/ML. We aim to create positive ripple effects that will carry into the future and influence how the government uses AI to serve the public.\n\n",

      "content": "### The challenge\n\n10x inherits GSA’s vision of an effective and efficient government. To play our part in helping make that a reality, we need to keep our finger on the pulse of developments, challenges, and opportunities in the govtech space. With that in mind, about a year ago, the 10x team met with top federal IT executives and colleagues to discuss projects we were hoping to evangelize and make connections for, while also learning about the technology challenges and opportunities they see for their agencies. We gain invaluable intelligence and inspiration from these colleagues that helps guide our investment strategy.\n\n_“The value of 10x isn’t in the achievements or adoption of any individual product. Rather, the value of 10x is in the ideas we surface. **In order for the government to truly modernize and deliver excellent public service in the digital age, agencies don’t just need better software, they need new ideas for how to tackle long-standing problems.”**_\n~ Shared by Federal IT Executive\n\nWhat they’re suggesting is that we need to produce value not just in the form of technology, but also in innovation—new ideas about how the federal government can do tech differently. This is the challenge that 10x chose to take on, and this is where the concept 10x dark matter comes in. Dark Matter represents the innovations that 10x discovers that aren’t product-shaped. For this year’s Dark Matter, we’re going to explore ideas that are largely drawn on our [Shared Components for Museums and Libraries project](https://10x.gsa.gov/projects/shared-components-for-museums-and-libraries/).\n\n### The Innovation\n\n**This year, one of the most exciting innovations we found is the possibility of applying Internet of Things capabilities to public service in creative new ways.**\n\nWe found these opportunities quite unexpectedly, and we assume there are more.\n\nTwo concepts are key to understanding this year’s dark matter content.\n\nFirst is the **digital divide**, which refers to how different populations face gaps in access to technology. Factors like income, age, and geographical location can determine where a person falls.\n\nPeople who are less-connected face a number of disadvantages, including difficulty participating in the digital economy. A practical and timely example are the challenges people without reliable internet access faced in adapting to life during COVID-19. This included shifting to remote work and remote schooling.\n\nMany levels of government have tried to solve, **or bridge, the digital divide for years. This area has great potential for innovation.**\n\nSecond is the Internet of Things, or IoT. IoT is a proliferating technology based on networks of physical devices that can receive and send information over the internet, often with embedded software or sensors. Good examples of IoT technology include smart home devices, like wifi-enabled thermostats. In the public sector, existing IoT uses include sensor-driven traffic control and waste management systems in city and municipal governments.\n\n",
      "content2": "In general, current applications of IoT within the federal government cluster around internal agency operations, such as:\n\n- supply chain management,\n- inventory tracking,\n- facilities access, and\n- various security and surveillance uses.\n\nSome agencies use IoT to monitor climate and ecosystems environmental sensors. But mostly, IoT capabilities across the federal government focus on improving agencies’ internal operations. We don’t have many recorded instances of federal agencies using IoT to directly meet their mission in a way that is public-facing.\n\nIn addition, most of these technologies were acquired by procuring commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products from software vendors. The few agencies that have built IoT capabilities in-house did so because the commercial solutions were not available for their specific business needs.\n\nOur work last year stands out among federal government use cases of IoT, because we use it in a direct, mission-delivery way. Our innovations can help bridge the digital divide.\n\n**As far as we know, our work is the first technology project in the federal government that**\n\n- **developed in-house IoT capabilities**\n- **used open-source software that is compatible with inexpensive and readily available open-source hardware,**\n- **neither collects nor stores sensitive information, and**\n- **is freely available and documented on the web for anyone to use.**\n\nThe best part is that our user base is librarians embedded in communities across the country who can use our IoT technology to make data-informed decisions that benefit their patrons.\n\nAnd if that isn’t the best part, then the best part is that we discovered a new way of getting disconnected folks online. We helped the government reimagine ways to bridge the digital divide.\n\n### The Project\n\nThe project started as an exploration into the possibility of developing reusable, open-source digital components for Social Safety Net benefits programs.\n\nIt changed into a project looking at shared components for museums and libraries.\n\nWe shifted our focus when our research clearly showed the critical role that libraries have played helping people access technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also helped that a strong federal agency with relevant subject-matter expertise agreed to work with us.\n\nWe soon discovered that a key problem that libraries face is understanding the details of their patrons’ wifi usage.\n\nMany libraries provide wifi access, a key resource that allows people to apply for jobs or unemployment benefits when they lack access at home. Having data on wifi usage helps libraries make budget decisions and influences when they offer wifi services.\n\nFirst, we produced a new way for libraries to collect data on wifi usage. The IoT technology we developed includes open-source code that runs on open-source hardware, acting as a sensor that collects and transmits data on wifi usage within libraries. It includes details on peak times of usage, the number of connected devices, and duration of visits.\n\nAlso, it provides baseline, structured data that will allow libraries to track changes in wifi usage year-after-year, or even day-by-day. The data can also be exchanged with other granting and policy agencies at the state or federal levels.\n\nMore than 20 local libraries across the country use the prototype devices we developed. Our technology\n\n- saves libraries time and money,\n- replaces paper-based processes,\n- is decentralized (libraries can use the tools completely independently of 10x or federal involvement), and\n- mitigates agency concerns about privacy by not collecting any sensitive information.\n\nSecond, we developed a novel hotspot capability. We discovered this by accident. Our engineers found that the open-source software stack we built serves as a wifi hotspot when connected to a USB cellular modem, with minor modifications to the source code. We believe this technology could scale for use in schools, community centers, and other places where the digital divide is widest.\n\nThe last—and perhaps most important—demonstrated value from our work is that it’s worth the government’s while to look for new, better ways to ensure that people on both sides of the divide can benefit from emerging trends in technology.\n\nTo many people, wifi-controlled robotic vacuum cleaners and smart refrigerators are out of reach. Internal federal agency operation-focused implementations of IoT feel a bit removed from direct public service and are unlikely to deliver tangible benefits to individual members of the public.\n\nOur project hasn't solved the digital divide, but it shows how our program is addressing a complex problem in society through innovation. We’ve proven that the federal government can play a constructive role to ensure that all Americans are able to benefit from the latest technologies that are transforming everyday life. We can find innovative ways to harness them ethically, securely, in the open, and always in the pursuit of excellent public service.\n\nFrom our perspective, the solutions we offer prove there are viable, innovative IoT applications in the federal government that have not been explored before. After all, we never set out to “do an IoT project”. We landed on this approach by chance, and only through thorough research and prototyping. With further investment and experimentation, we believe federal agencies can uncover many more IoT applications.\n\n"

      "content": "We’re 100% convinced that FY22 is going to be busy, exciting, and challenging. We have projects advancing into technology we’ve never worked with before. There is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to multiply our impact by funding more work than ever. And new doors have opened that can help scale and support our projects post-10x when the projects complete Phase Four. Here are a few things we’re expecting to come across over the next 365 days and how we’re thinking about them:\n\n**Scaling and Multiplying**\n\nTwo things will be important for us in FY22:\n\n- First, the [American Rescue Plan (ARP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/) will be significant for 10x in FY22.\n- Second, we’re expecting to clone our own model and help other agencies replicate something similar to 10x within their organizations.\nOur organization—the Technology Transformation Services—received [ARP funding](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/tts-american-rescue-plan/tts-american-rescue-plan-projects-and-impact) specifically to recover, rebuild, and reimagine digital public service delivery in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. 10x will use some of these funds to reimagine digital public service delivery, which is something we’re particularly good at.\n\nWith this ARP support, we’ll fund more work across phases to experiment with and uncover new opportunities for how small improvements can provide a huge impact for the government’s response to COVID-19. We’ll be able to fund around 40 new Phase One projects in FY22 compared to about 20 in FY21.\n\nAlso, we will transfer support for our advanced projects to the TTS ARP Program Management Office (PMO) when\n\n- our projects align specifically to the spirit of the TTS ARP, and/or\n- require significant financial advancement to deliver impact beyond what 10x can provide in Phase Four.\n\nThis new collaboration with the TTS ARP PMO will make our work even more impactful. If they are considering work that may have potential, but is unproven, we will take the lead,  putting it through our investment phases. We can identify this work’s potential and viability, before TTS considers this work for more substantial support. We want to formally pursue a goal we’ve had for years: helping other organizations in government spin-up initiatives that harness what we’ve learned and use some of our methods.\n\nIn addition, we’re actively talking to multiple federal agencies who want to work with us to recreate our model in their organization. We will help these other agencies, but also recognize that the agency partners will have to do the real work:\n\n- Finding funding,\n- Finding a safe space to operate within their agency’s bureaucracy, and\n- Getting buy-in from leadership for standing-up a 10x-like process.\nThese steps won’t be easy, but we'll help all we can.\n\nWe also recognize that there is always room for improvement. We know there are opportunities to do things differently while keeping our basic risk-mitigation, iterative model intact.\n\nWe fully expect these initiatives in other agencies will differ from our program, since they will need to be tailored to fit the funding, culture, and IT environments in other agencies.\n\n"
