  "excerpt": "Most government agencies rely on data from other agencies, state and local governments, and other data providers to make informed decisions on policy, operations, and budgets, but itâ€™s currently very time consuming and complex to aggregate this data in a meaningful way. The team developed best practices and repeatable processes and tools that make it easier to collect, combine, standardize, govern, maintain, and exchange data across federal agencies.",
