The project team worked very closely with dozens of compliance attorneys to agree on precise language and common interpretations of the law so they could better explain its purpose, how it works, and how to stay on the right side of compliance—taking decades of legalese and translating it into plain-language web content, lowering the barrier for feds to collect key information from the public so they can continue to improve government services.

  "body": "In order for the government to deliver excellent public service, civil servants must be able to interact with the public to understand their needs. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), passed in 1995,  governs how federal agencies collect information from the American public. But, PRA is often viewed as a blocker to meaningful interaction between the government and the public. The spirit of PRA is to reduce the burden on the public to respond to duplicative calls for information by the government, but there is much confusion around the law and how to navigate it. 10x spent three phases looking at PRA to see how we might help.",

We focused on a key audience with specific needs  —  smaller agencies without dedicated internal PRA support—and conducted research with them to understand their needs. Then, we partnered with legal experts who have deep knowledge of the law to interpret the necessary components and guidance into user-friendly digital content, Finally,  we built a website to host this guidance.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nPRA.digital.gov lives as a partnership between GSA and OMB. GSA maintains the digital infrastructure; OMB maintains and updates the content. ",

The site as it exists today is the perfect foundation for expansion.  With further enhancements, the government can demystify the PRA process for many thousands more government employees who want to both serve the public and stay in compliance with the law."
