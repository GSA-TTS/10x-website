  "excerpt": "A lot of government websites fall short when compared to the private sector—they can be less secure, less accessible, and less monitored. The project team worked to improve this by creating Spotlight, a website scanner that allows government web managers to gather real-time intel on the performance of the websites they oversee. The tool runs customizable scans and provides data about everything from the use of the U.S. Web Design System to the presence of secure web components, with more functionality coming each sprint.",
  "body": "Federal websites are some of the most critical channels the government uses to communicate information to the public; however, there are so many requirements and best practices to keep track of that this landscape can be bewildering. This project explored how modern tools can empower federal government web managers to do their jobs more efficiently. Through careful research and partnerships with existing actors in the federal web space, 10x designed, built, and shipped a product that helps web managers meet the public’s needs. Spotlight (formerly known as Site Scanner) is a customizable, automated scanning service that generates real-time intelligence for agencies that they can use to improve their websites to better serve the public. Spotlight not only reduces the legwork that this type of work has traditionally involved, but it also promotes compliance with various government mandates, including the use of U.S. Web Design System components and certain security protocols.",

It is also still an active 10x project, currently in Phase 4. As part of Phase 4 work, the team is looking for ways to expand Spotlight to serve as many different users as possible. Currently, the team is building out the front-end interface of the scanner to allow more non-technical users to benefit from the tool, in addition to developing new scanning capabilities. "
