Any federal employee is eligible to submit an idea to 10x through our website using our [submission form](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1Im8dTPnjnV3HpP). We expect to finalize the list of projects we select for funding in early 2022, and plan to kick-off these new projects at Phase One by March, 2022.\n\nAs always, 10x accepts ideas on a broad range of topics across the federal technology ecosystem and your ideas don’t need to align to a particular theme; however, we do have specific investment priorities, and ideas that align to these themes will receive greater attention when we're deliberating on which project ideas to fund. Here are the new, hot-off-the-press 10x investment themes for our first round of project funding for Fiscal Year 2022. \n\n## Investment themes\n\n### Reimagining public engagement\n\n10x is interested in supporting projects that help the government reimagine ways to better understand and respond to the priorities and needs of the public.\n\nThe ideas we are looking for here will answer the question: “How can the government use technology to better engage with the public, understand their needs, and respond appropriately?”\n\nA few example topics that meet the spirit of this theme include opportunities for the government and the public to co-design and build products and services together, improving the government’s ability to quickly respond to public inquiries and comments, improving customer experience for the public, and finding ways to elevate community-level concerns.\n\n### Digital responses to climate challenges\n\n10x is interested in supporting projects that will help the government prepare for the climate challenges of the near future. \n\nThe ideas we are looking for under this theme will answer the question: “What do we as a government need to do now to meet the environmental and climate-related challenges that our country will face in twenty years?”\n\nA few example topics that meet the spirit of this theme include adaptation to climate change, resilient communities, disaster preparedness, infrastructure, and ecosystem conservation.\n\n### Equity in delivery\n\n10x is interested in supporting projects that address issues of justice and ensure that all members of the public have equitable access to services and information. \n\nThe ideas we are looking for under this theme will answer the question: “How can the government use technology to address current and past injustices in our society to promote an equitable future for all?” \n\nA few example topics that meet the spirit of this theme include civil rights awareness, serving the underserved, proactive transparency, privacy preservation, and simplifying the process for understanding government services and programs."

      "body": "### One more thing to keep in mind\n\nThose of you who have been following our work (and sending ideas our way!) for a while may notice that this year’s themes are similar to last year’s themes. This is intentional. Overall, we were very pleased with the outcomes of the tailored investment themes we piloted last round. Last year’s themes covered topics that are just as relevant today, if not more so. This time, we’ve tweaked the theme descriptions to provide a little more clarity.\n\nBecause the themes are similar, we encourage folks to take a look at [the list of projects we funded last round](https://10x.gsa.gov/posts/2021-selected-projects/). This will give folks ideas on the types of projects we want to fund as well as avoid duplicating an idea we’re already working on.\n\n## About 10x\n\n10x is an investment program that takes ideas submitted by federal employees and turns them into technology projects that improve how the government delivers excellence for the public. We accept ideas on a rolling basis, and evaluate and select ideas once or twice a year. 10x is a part of GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) division. TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants.",
