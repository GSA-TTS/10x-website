Any federal employee is eligible to submit an idea to 10x through our website using our submission form. We expect to finalize the list of projects we select for funding in early 2023, and plan to kick-off these new projects at Phase One in Spring 2023.\n\nAs always, 10x accepts ideas on a broad range of topics across the federal technology ecosystem and your ideas don’t need to align to a particular theme; however, we do have specific investment priorities, and ideas that align to these themes will receive greater attention when we're deliberating on which project ideas to fund. Here are the new, hot-off-the-press 10x investment themes for our first round of project funding for Fiscal Year 2023.\n\n## Digital foundations\n\n**10x wants your ideas on how the government can build an innovative digital infrastructure to ‘pave the way’ for an innovative physical infrastructure.**\n\nThis is a new focus for 10x, and we chose it because we have observed momentum around new investments in infrastructure across government. From bridges to broadband, we believe 10x has an opportunity to explore the digital landscape that will accompany new infrastructure investments and to do what 10x does best: solve problems and uncover transformative opportunities. \n\nExample topics that meet the spirit of this theme include transparency in infrastructure investments, promoting an equitable distribution of infrastructure funding, finding new ways of involving communities in the design of infrastructure projects, and envisioning how the government can prepare for the roll-out of new technologies. \n\nA good brainstorming question to generate ideas for this theme is: *How can technology improve how the government thinks about and implements infrastructure projects?* \n\n## Equity in delivery\n\n**10x wants your ideas for projects that will improve how the government serves those most in need of help.**\n\nThis has been a focus of 10x for years and we’re carrying it into FY23. From our work with bias in AI to reimagining ways to bridge the digital divide, we believe our projects have demonstrated the value of the 10x model, and highlight how ripe the equitable tech space is for new innovation.\n\nExample topics that meet the spirit of this theme include civil rights awareness, privacy preservation, simplifying the process for understanding government services and programs, environmental justice, and social safety net innovations.\n\nA good brainstorming question to generate ideas for this theme is: *What government-provided services could use technology to better serve the people typically left out or frequently overlooked?*\n\n## Something new\n\nThis year, 10x is offering additional support to civil servants who want to submit an idea, but aren't sure where to start. We are offering individual feedback on your idea with a member of the 10x team. We can't write your idea for you, but we can help you get on the right track. In addition, we're offering workshops to help you and your team come up with great, submission-worthy ideas. Want more info? [Get in touch](mailto:10x@gsa.gov).",
