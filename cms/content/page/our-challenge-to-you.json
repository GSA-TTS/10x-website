Here are some pitches that 10x has funded. \n\n### Federal grant reporting\n\n“This project will identify opportunities to improve the federal grant reporting process, by eliminating redundancies and creating efficiencies through improved technology — with the goal of generating a prototype that could be adapted across federal programs, thereby increasing federal grant programs’ efficacy to those being served as well as taxpayers’ return on investment.”\n\n### Notifications as a service\n\n“TTS will investigate the opportunity to provide a common solution for government notifications to citizens via email, text message, and other contact methods. Many of the tools that TTS and other agencies build require a notification component, and this project will help TTS understand whether consolidating the ability to send notifications into a shared service available to all agencies would be effective.”\n\n### Guide to the Paperwork Reduction Act\n\n“OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is charged with overseeing federal compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Agencies often cite frustration with accessing and understanding OMB’s policies on the PRA, which are spread across numerous inaccessible PDFs. This situation has reduced compliance and created delays in the approval of information collection requests (ICRs). Through outreach to PRA desk officers and agency staff, and in consultation with OIRA, TTS will explore what it would take to modernize the way agencies interact with OMB’s policies in order to design an accessible, user-friendly online interface to respond to agency inquiries.”\n\n<Button color=\"primary-dark\" url=\"/\">SUBMIT AN IDEA</Button>\n\n## Need some help?\n\nIf you’d like help putting together an idea or have questions about what we’re looking for toss an email our way. We’re happy to connect you with a technology expert or someone to review what you have and make sure your idea is on point.\n\n## What happens to my idea after I hit “Submit”?\n\nTiming is everything. We evaluate submissions twice a year, generally in February and August. So while we’ll let you know we received your idea right away, you might not hear whether it’s been selected for a while – but you’ll definitely hear either way when the time comes. Yeah, yeah, we know. Hurry up and wait. \n\nTo find out what happens after that, learn more about [how we select and fund ideas](https://10x.gsa.gov). \n\n### It’s a coffee date, not a commitment\n\nWhile the ideas come from federal employees across the government, those folks aren’t ultimately involved in the selection process. We intentionally leave them out to get a clear, unbiased assessment of the project’s potential success and need. \n\nBut we do look to the idea submitter (hopefully, that’s you!) as a domain expert to suggest resources and research for us to consider. They’re an integral part of the Phase 1 kickoff and can attend phase close-out meetings to keep tabs on how (or if) the project is progressing. \n\n"
