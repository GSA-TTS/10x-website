We believe that the most creative, game-changing ideas come from those who work most closely to the problem—people like  you. \n\nWe invite any federal employee to submit an idea for how to use technology to improve public service. Twice a year, we evaluate submissions and choose the most promising ones for a deeper dive into their potential impact, feasibility, and scope. We’re talking things like using artificial intelligence to eliminate bias, improving the public’s experience with the federal government, and sharing data and analytics across agencies. So, how do you want to improve public service?\n\n</Col>\n\n<Col desktop=\"4\">\n\n<Card>\n\n10x has funded 68 projects in 2020. \nWill the next be yours? \n\nOur next submission deadline is February 2021.\n\n<Button color=\"primary\" url=\"/\">SUBMIT AND IDEA</Button>\n\n</Card>\n\n</Col>\n\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n\n<Col size=\"12\">\n\n## What's new with us\n\n<Break color=\"accent-cool\" />\n\n<Row>\n\n<Col size=\"12\" tablet=\"6\"><Card title=\"Featured Project\">Using machine learning to combat bias</Card></Col>\n<Col size=\"12\" tablet=\"6\"><Card title=\"Inside Look\">View 10x Lightening Talks from successful idea submitters</Card></Col>\n<Col size=\"12\" tablet=\"6\"><Card title=\"Media\">Government reinvention with a venture capital mindset</Card></Col>\n<Col size=\"12\" tablet=\"6\"><Card title=\"Awards\">10x is proud to have been recognized with a 2019 Public Sector Innovation award</Card></Col>\n\n</Col>\n\n</Row>\n\n</Grid>",
