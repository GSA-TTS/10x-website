About one third⅓ ofOnly one or two of every 10 projects selected for initial funding will actually make its way into design and development work, and even those projects must be able to prove they’re delivering clear value in order to continue to receive funding. This iterative approach to investing allows us to innovate without overspending, ensuring the products and services produced meet a real, verifiable need in the federal space."
