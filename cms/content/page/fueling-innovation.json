But instead of throwing a large bucket of money at a hypothetical solution, we start small with the exploration and development of those ideas, only moving forward after rigorous analysis that proves the idea will be successful. It’s like venture capital investments — by government, for government — except the return on investment is making government work better for all. \n\nMany government technology projects fail. Sometimes it’s because the contract wasn’t set up for success. Sometimes projects fail because of budget overruns. And some projects are just duplicative of efforts happening elsewhere. By researching and monitoring the potential impact of each project at several steps along the way — and not being afraid to pull the plug if we discover something won’t be successful — we don’t waste time or resources pursuing deadend projects. We fail fast so we can fall forward.",

What started in 2015 as a one-time-only Shark Tank-ish competition evolved into a monthly mini-pitch competition based on ideas from employees. We then added more structure and rigor to our investment strategy. Taking everything we’d learned thus far, we founded 10x in 2017 and continue to refine and improve the process — for instance, we now use a four-phased approach, while providing project teams with better guidance and support.   \n\nTl; dr — we put our money where our mouths are, applying the 10x process of critical thinking and iterative improvement to ourselves as we continue to learn and change our approach to optimize outcomes.",
