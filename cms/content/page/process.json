Feds submit their ideas through a simple form, and we evaluate them using a formal process twice a year (generally in February and August). But only a handful of the most promising ideas submitted are selected for Phase 1 funding. \n\nAs we explore ideas, we whittle down projects to move on to the next phase, where we continue to research and iterate on the idea. Rinse and repeat, until an idea fails to move on to the next phase or graduates from the process, which can happen anywhere along the journey that we feel the solution is ready for go-time. \n\n## It’s a funnel, not a tunnel\n\nWe purposefully decide to continue funding and developing an idea at each stage in the process, which means that deciding what not to advance to the next phase is as important as choosing what will. By applying lean development principles and targeting the most impactful ideas, we can focus time and resources on the things that have the best chance of success. \n\nIn August 2020 we:"

The team consults subject matter experts, customers, and others to reach a “hard no” (there’s something blocking this from being successful), or a “soft yes” (continue exploring this idea based on what we know thus far).\n\nEvery new project starts at Phase 1 —  there’s no jumping the line, no matter how much research has already been done. Part of the rigor of our process, and how we ensure unbiased, data-based decision-making, is that the team asks key questions at each phase before deciding how to move forward."
