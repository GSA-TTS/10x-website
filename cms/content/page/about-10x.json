We fund internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.\n\nWe focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov), and the [TTS Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/tts).\n\nOur funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x is a program that lives within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and is managed by the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs).\n\n## Calls for ideas\n\n10x will be selecting ideas for the next round of Phase One funding in April. Please submit your ideas to us by 11:59 PM EST on March 23rd to have your idea considered for funding. This time around, we have selected three investment themes that we are interested in adding to our portfolio. As always, we will consider ideas from a wide variety of topic areas, but we are particularly interested in support projects that align with one or more of the following themes: \n\n *Public Lands & Environment* - 10x is interested in supporting projects and agencies that protect and/or promote public lands and the environment. Examples of topics that fall under this category include climate change, national parks, conservation efforts, and access to public lands. \n\n*Public Trust & Civic Life* - 10x is interested in supporting projects that help rebuild trust in government and promote civic engagement. Examples of topics that fall under this category include accountability, transparency, findability (resources, information, forms, etc.), and direct public engagement with the government. \n\n*Equity in Delivery* - 10x is interested in supporting projects that promote equitable public service. Examples of topics that fall under this category include equity for underserved communities, racial justice, gender equality, and civil rights.\n\n<Button url=\"/\" color=\"accent-warm\">Pitch an idea<br /><span>\nusing our Submission form</span></Button>\n\n## 10x privacy policy\n\n### Information you send us as a pitch\n\nFederal employees can voluntarily send us information as part of an idea submission for 10x funding by sending an email message to [10x@gsa.gov](mailto:10x@gsa.gov) or by submitting a project idea through our online form. Your idea will be shared with subject-matter experts and the 10x Program Advisory Board in order to make funding decisions. We publish information about which ideas do and do not receive funding, along with the date of submission, your name, and the name of your agency or organization. If your idea is accepted for funding, your name and home agency will be listed on our website. In some cases, we might feature your actual idea on our website for teaching and promotion purposes.\n\nWe cannot accept ideas from the general public. If you are **not** a federal employee and you submit an idea for funding, we’ll only use your information to reply to your message. We will not keep the information you sent as part of your idea.\n\n### Everything else\n\nFor everything else, we follow the practices outlined in GSA’s [privacy and security notice](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/privacy-and-security-notice).\n\n</Grid>\n\n<LocationMenu />",
