We fund internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.\n\nWe focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov), and the [TTS Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/tts).\n\nOur funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x is a program that lives within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and is managed by the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs).\n\n## Calls for ideas\n\n10x recently completed our idea evaluations and all idea authors have been notified about whether or not their projects were selected for Phase One funding. We expect to kick-off these new projects in October 2020. We will hold our next idea evaluations in the second quarter of the current fiscal year--January or February, 2021. As always, we accept idea submissions on a rolling basis and we invite you to submit your ideas whenever you are ready.\n\n<Button url=\"/\" color=\"accent-warm\">Pitch an idea<br /><span>\nusing our Submission form</span></Button>\n\n## 10x privacy policy\n\n### Information you send us as a pitch\n\nFederal employees can voluntarily send us information as part of an idea submission for 10x funding by sending an email message to [10x@gsa.gov](mailto:10x@gsa.gov) or by submitting a project idea through our online form. Your idea will be shared with subject-matter experts and the 10x Program Advisory Board in order to make funding decisions. We publish information about which ideas do and do not receive funding, along with the date of submission, your name, and the name of your agency or organization. If your idea is accepted for funding, your name and home agency will be listed on our website. In some cases, we might feature your actual idea on our website for teaching and promotion purposes.\n\nWe cannot accept ideas from the general public. If you are **not** a federal employee and you submit an idea for funding, we’ll only use your information to reply to your message. We will not keep the information you sent as part of your idea.\n\n### Everything else\n\nFor everything else, we follow the practices outlined in GSA’s [privacy and security notice](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/privacy-and-security-notice).\n\n</Grid>\n\n<LocationMenu />\n",
