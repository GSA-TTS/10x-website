We believe that the most creative, game-changing ideas come from those who work most closely to the problem—people like  you. \n\nWe invite any federal employee to submit an idea for how to use technology to improve public service. Twice a year, we evaluate submissions and choose the most promising ones for a deeper dive into their potential impact, feasibility, and scope. We’re talking things like using artificial intelligence to eliminate bias, improving the public’s experience with the federal government, and sharing data and analytics across agencies. So, how do you want to improve public service?\n\n<Break color=\"accent-warm\" variant=\"wide\" />\n\n</Col>\n\n<Col size=\"12\" desktop=\"4\">\n\n<Card className=\"Home__callout\">\n\n#### 10x has funded 68 projects in 2020.
